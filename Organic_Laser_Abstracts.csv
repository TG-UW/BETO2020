The p-type copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) was used to form the active layer. Different kinds of metallic materials were used for source and drain electrodes. Multilayer donor substrates were prepared by the successive depositions of materials by either thermal evaporation under vacuum or laser printing. The materials were transferred together in a single step onto a receiver substrate by laser pulses in the picosecond regime. The latter substrate formed the gate and the dielectric of the transistor. The results are compared with the step-by-step laser printing process, where electrodes and organic layer were successively printed from two different donor substrates. The multilayer laser printing reveals an improvement of the performances of the OTFT devices.",,,,1.0,,

The favorably used host/guest system PFO, containing 6,6′-(2,2′-octyloxy-1,1′-bianphthalene) binaphthyl spacer groups (BN-PFO), doped with 1,4-bis(2-(4-(N,N-di(p-tolyl)amino)phenyl)vinylbenzene (DPAVB) shows a dramatic decrease of laser emission for excitation pulses longer than a few nanoseconds, whereas the undoped material offers a stable emission. By measuring the optical gain and the triplet absorption spectra we show that the spectral overlap of the two spectra leads to a dramatic increase of the laser threshold in the doped system due to a pile-up of long lived triplet states. On the contrary for BN-PFO, optical gain and triplet absorption are found to be spectrally separated. As a result, accumulated triplet excitons hardly affect the laser emission.",,,,2.0,,

Shot-to-shot behavior of the line intensities relative to the sample constituents was studied. The detected plasma was not stoichiometric and the line intensities, as well as their ratios, were changing even for an order of magnitude from one sampling point to another, particularly in the case of aromatic compounds. We explained some sources of such LIBS signal's behavior and this allowed us to establish a data processing procedure, which leads to a good linearization among the data sets. In this way, it was possible to determine some real differences between the LIBS spectra from explosives and interferents, and to correlate them with molecular formulas, with some known pathways for the molecule's decomposition and with successive chemical reactions in the plasma. Number spectral parameters, which distinguish the each studied explosive from other organic materials, were also determined and compared with previously published results relative to percentages of correct classifications for the same explosives.

Electrical characterization of the FET shows the device to have a hysteresis-free operation in its transfer characteristics, a low threshold voltage of −0.2 V, and a field-effect mobility of 0.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1.

The in vitro permeation has been determined using a Franz diffusion cell, with porcine skin and nude mouse skin as the barriers. Hyperproliferative and ultraviolet (UV)-irradiated skins were also used as barrier models to mimic the clinical therapeutic conditions. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was used to examine the in vivo nude mouse skin uptake of peptide, FITC, and FD. Both in vitro and in vivo results indicated an improvement in permeant skin delivery by the laser. The laser fluence and number of passes were found to play important roles in controlling drug transport. Increases of 46- and 127-fold in imiquimod flux were detected using the respective fluences of 2 and 3 J/cm2 with 4 pulses. An imiquimod concentration of 0.4% from aqueous vehicle with laser treatment was sufficient to approximate the flux from the commercial cream with an imiquimod dose of 5% without laser treatment, indicating a reduction of the drug dose by 125-fold. The enhancement of peptide permeation was size and sequence dependent, with the smaller molecular weight (MW) and more-hydrophilic entities showing greater enhancing effect.

A laser pulse in the context of the review is of ultra-short duration if the pulse is shorter than all major relaxation times. Such pulses excite only electrons, leaving the lattice cold for the time required for the transfer of the absorbed laser energy from the heated electrons to the lattice. For this reason, any laser-induced phase transformations occur in non-equilibrium conditions, making properties of the material drastically different from their equilibrium counterparts. We study laser interaction with matter in a broad range of intensities from those inducing subtle atomic excitations (∼1010 W/cm2) up to high intensity (∼1016 W/cm2), when solid is swiftly transformed into hot and dense plasma. The phenomena emerging in succession in response to increasing laser intensity, namely, the excitations of coherent phonons, phase transitions, ablation, and transformation of material into plasma, are described in consecutive chapters.

In the sintering process ink particles are heated to a certain, ink-specific temperature. During the sintering process the carrier fluid and dispersing agents are evaporated from the ink. Additional heating after evaporation causes the nanoparticles to start to agglomerate.

The individual effect of four different imidazolium ionic liquids – 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([C4mim][PF6]), 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([C6mim][PF6]), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([C4mim][BF4]), and 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([C6mim][BF4]) on the solubility of sulfur in toluene was also studied. The results show that both the structures of the cations and concentrations of ionic liquids used to play important roles in the solubility of elemental sulfur.

The fine-tuning of this kinase/phosphatase balance is thus critical for neuronal adaptation, transition to long-term responses and higher brain functions including specific behaviors. Data emerging from several biological systems may suggest that disruption of this dynamic cell signaling balance within specific brain sub-regions leads to behavioral impairments.

N fertilizer management often relies upon measurements of crop spectral reflectance using ground-based optical on-the-go sensors or hand-held chlorophyll meters. However, soil background reflectance can confound on-the-go sensing, especially during early crop growth stages, and hand-held chlorophyll meters are impractical for spatially explicit mapping at the field scale. Scanning laser technology is available that measures the intensity of the reflected laser light plus height information within a mm-scale ground instantaneous field of view at a very high sampling rate (up to 50,000 points s−1 in this study). We examined the ability to quantify foliar N status of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) using a green (532 nm) terrestrial laser scanner during an early stem extension growth stage (Zadoks growth stage 3.2). Laser data were processed by (1) removing soil background returns based on laser-determined height information, (2) standardizing green laser intensity based on white-reference panel readings, and (3) filtering noisy laser returns from leaf edges based on a laser return intensity threshold value. The return intensity of the reflected green laser light more accurately (r2 = 0.68, RMSE = 0.30 μg g−1) predicted foliar N concentration than conventional chlorophyll meter readings (r2 = 0.36, RMSE = 0.41 μg g−1) and spectral indices measured by a ground optical on-the-go sensor (r2 < 0.41, RMSE > 0.39 μg g−1). The results indicate that laser scanners are useful for measuring the N status of wheat during early growth stages, and provide justification for incorporating laser scanner based measurements into developing spatially-explicit estimates of foliar N during this critical growth period.

Direct laser patterning (DLP) of self-assembled monolayers (SAM) is achieved by localized heating of the sample above the SAM desorption temperature. Through use of elliptical laser beams in the present work, three goals are achieved by analyzing the heat diffusion model and related thermo-kinetics model: (1) optimal working conditions (combination of laser power, scanning velocity and aspect ratio) for DLP to produce maximum feature size, or highest processing velocity at a given power; (2) identification of conditions that reduces the potential thermal damage to the substrate; (3) shedding light on issues related to uniformity or homogeneity of heating a substrate using an elliptical laser beam. A heat diffusion model is employed to provide the resulting surface temperature caused by elliptical laser beams, and the coupled thermo-kinetics model is used to determine the final SAM coverage generated by DLP. Parametric analysis revealed that 70–150 mW can be used to pattern feature sizes in the range of 2–10 times of equivalent circular beam size. It is also found that each elliptical laser beam has a unique optimal aspect ratio to result in the widest feature size for a given laser power and scanning velocity. The edge transition width increases with an increase of the aspect ratio. Keeping the aspect ratio of elliptical laser beam small (i.e. β<20), a sharp edge definition could be obtained; if an aspect ratio larger than 30 is used, a surface with gradual edge definition could be obtained.",,,,0.0,,

The measured accuracies was in agreement with the Seronorm CRM certified values, except for Mn, Zn, Ba and Cd, which presented absolute differences higher than the expanded uncertainty for these elements. The within-run precision was less than 5.7% (relative standard deviation, RSD), except for the analyses of Be, and Mn (8.6% and 11.1%, respectively). The reproducibility (between-run precision) was calculated in terms of the RSD obtained for 12 analyses (i.e., four replicates of each sample in three analytical runs). Apart from Be, Mn, and Zn, the reproducibilities of all the elements listed above ranged between 4.0% and 8.5%. In contrast, for Cd, the concentration obtained was significantly different from the certified value; analyses of this element exhibited low reproducibility. Applying the matrix-matched calibration method, the accuracy for Cd measured was in agreement with both SRM966 and BCR 635; thus, matrix-matched calibration is a practical means of overcoming matrix-enhancement effects for the quantification of Cd.

We focus on exploring this interplay in modern soils and paleosols of southeast Sardinia (Italy), integrating two innovative techniques to a traditional pedological study: (i) laser ablation ICP-MS spot analyses applied to detect microscale distribution of trace elements in discrete soil features of organic-mineral (A) and argillic (Bt) horizons in thin sections, and (ii) radioactive disequilibria as tracers and chronometers of pedogenetic alteration and geomorphic dynamics. The Pleistocene paleosols developed mainly during interglacial periods, with important clay illuviation and rubification. The other soils are essentially characterized by organic matter incorporation into the profiles. Field discontinuities described within soil profiles, related to phases of sediment aggradation and/or surface erosion, are often supported by laboratory results, mainly micromorphological and geochemical data. LA-ICP-MS data show an overall trend of increase of most trace elements (REEs included) from skeletal rock fragments to both clayey and organic-rich soil matrix to clay coatings. This pathway is clearly controlled by the degree of weathering of primary minerals and by pedogenetic processes, where element adsorption onto reactive sites of organic matter and clay particles and clay illuviation play prominent roles.

Fluorescence emission maxima (λmax 544 nm) and relative fluorescence intensities for NBD-β-CyD and NBD-β-CyD/amantadine were virtually identical, precluding the use of emission spectrum shifts for distinguishing free NBD-β-CyD from the complex. Intracellular accumulation of NBD-β-CyD was studied in HepG2 and SK-MEL-24 cells using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). No major differences were observed between uptake of NBD-β-CyD and NBD-β-CyD/amantadine. Serum proteins did not perturb uptake, whereas temperature-dependent uptake, indicative of cell entry via diffusion, was observed. Intracellular distribution favoured mitochondria, with less fluorescent material present in cytoplasm and none in cell nuclei. No experimental evidence of NBD-β-CyD breakdown to NBD-glucose was found upon chromatographic analysis of incubation mixtures, providing additional evidence of intact NBD-β-CyD entry into these cells.

Thus, establishing LIBS reference spectra from appropriate calibration standards must be undertaken diligently. Considering the global mineralogy of the Martian surface, and the possible landing sites, three specific compositions of igneous targets have been determined. Picritic, noritic, and shergottic glasses have been produced, along with a Macusanite natural glass. A sample of each target will fly on the MSL Curiosity rover deck, 1.56 m from the ChemCam instrument, and duplicates are available on the ground. Duplicates are considered to be identical, as the relative standard deviation (RSD) of the composition dispersion is around 8%. Electronic microprobe and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA ICP-MS) analyses give evidence that the chemical composition of the four silicate targets is very homogeneous at microscopic scales larger than the instrument spot size, with RSD < 5% for concentration variations > 0.1 wt.% using electronic microprobe, and < 10% for concentration variations > 0.01 wt.% using LA ICP-MS. The LIBS campaign on the igneous targets performed under flight-like Mars conditions establishes reference spectra for the entire mission. The LIBS spectra between 240 and 900 nm are extremely rich, hundreds of lines with high signal-to-noise, and a dynamical range sufficient to identify unambiguously major, minor and trace elements.

However, the influence of specific nanomaterial structural characteristics on the partitioning and colloidal stabilization of engineered nanomaterials in various ecological compartments remains underexplored. Herein, we present a systematic study of the interactions of humic acid (HA, as a model for NOM) with monodisperse, well-characterized, ligand-passivated HfO2, ZrO2, and solid-solution HfxZr1−xO2 nanoparticles (NPs). We note that mixing with HA induces the almost complete phase transfer of hydrophobically coated monoclinic metal oxide (MO) NPs from hexane to water. Furthermore, HA is seen to impart appreciable colloidal stabilization to the NPs in the aqueous phase. In contrast, phase transfer and aqueous-phase colloidal stabilization has not been observed for tetragonal MO-NPs. A mechanistic model for the phase transfer and aqueous dispersal of MO-NPs is proposed on the basis of evidence from transmission electron microscopy, ζ-potential measurements, dynamic light scattering, Raman and infrared spectroscopies, elemental analysis, and systematic experiments on a closely related set of MO-NPs with varying composition and crystal structure. The data indicate the synergistic role of over-coating (micellar), ligand substitution (coordinative), and electrostatic processes wherein HA acts both as an amphiphilic molecule and a charged chelating ligand. The strong observed preference for the phase transfer of monoclinic instead of tetragonal NPs indicates the importance of the preferential binding of HA to specific crystallographic facets and suggests the possibility of being able to design NPs to minimize their mobilities in the aquatic environment.",,,,0.0,,

In this study, we investigated how C storage, soil structure and unprotected, physically protected and resistant C pools recover 0, 7 and 20 years after mechanical harvesting and site preparation in second rotation Pinus radiata D.Don plantations. We detected differences in dry mean weight diameter (DMWD) of aggregates, with higher DMWD in 0- and 7-year-old pine stands (8.7 and 7.5 mm, respectively) than in 20-year-old stands (4.1 mm). This was attributed to the compaction induced by heavy machinery, as reflected by the positive relationship between DMWD and bulk density (r = 0.85, P < 0.05). Organic C contents in the top 5 cm were similar 0 and 7 years after disturbance, but were twice as high after 20 years, with mean values of 25, 28 and 52 Mg C ha−1, respectively. In addition, the resistant C pool was also reduced by up to 7% after clearance. In contrast, unprotected C and physically-protected C were greatest in the youngest stands, indicating that stand establishment and harvesting with heavy machinery may have broken soil aggregates and exposed the previously protected SOM to microbial decomposition and that forest operations may create new mega-aggregates able to protect organic residues. However, the lowest physically-protected C values in 20-year-old pine stands may also be attributed to differences in SOM quality. The alkyl C/O-alkyl C ratios were highest in the oldest stands, indicating that SOM in these stands was more resistant to further decomposition. Mechanized forest operations in radiata pine stands released at least 30 t C ha−1 from the first 5 cm of the soil profile immediately after clearance, caused significant alterations in the soil structure, which lasted for a minimum of seven years, and also reduced the resistant C pool.

These model systems are of a great importance not only in optoelectronic technologies but also in the life sciences in relation to respiration, photosynthesis and photomedicine. Results of studies of supermolecular systems composed of zinc porphyrin and its dyad covalently linked to one fullerene or two fullerene molecules (in chloroform solution and in the form of Langmuir–Blodgett layers on a gold substrate) are presented to illustrate the spectroscopic properties and electron transfer processes taking place in such systems. Some simpler models of donor–acceptor ensembles are also presented. Electronic absorption and fluorescence supported by reflectance–absorption in infrared and electron spin resonance spectroscopies as well examination of light-induced current generated in photoelectrochemical cells were used to follow the interactions, radiative and non-radiative processes accompanied with electron transfer from an electron donating species to an electron acceptor. The same methods could provide information on modification of the electronic structure of the systems. The observed changes in absorption and fluorescence quenching of porphyrins in the presence of fullerene have evidently shown charge redistribution both upon porphyrins linkage to fullerene and upon deposition of the systems on gold substrate resulting from the interaction between the organic layers and the solid. The results reported in this paper prove the donor–acceptor character of the zinc porphyrin–fullerene samples and influence of fullerene on dye photoactivity in the systems.",,,,0.0,,

Comparison of simulation results with real experimental measurements reveals that monomolecular recombination is the primary loss mechanism in OSCs. This conclusion is consistent with direct observations that bimolecular recombination is significantly suppressed in bulk heterojunction OSCs.

However, increasing the OLRs to 3.73 kg COD m−3 d−1 by reducing the hydraulic retention time (HRT) (4–2 d) reduced the COD removal efficiency (45%). Fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis showed that the microbial community of the reactor stages was dominated by methanogenic archaea (56–79% of 4′, 6 diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-stained cells in all stages) when the reactor was fed at OLR 0.86–2.98 kg COD m−3 d−1 but decreased in Stage 1 (30% of DAPI-stained cells) when the OLR was at 3.73 kg COD m−3 d−1. The two methanogenic genera detected were Methanosarcina and Methanosaeta. Generally, Methanosaeta dominated the reactor stages when the OLR was 0.86–1.86 kg COD m−3 d−1, while Methanosarcina dominated during the period of high OLR (2.98–3.73 kg COD m−3 d−1).

The highest individual values have been recorded in winter. No seasonal variation has been observed in OC, whereas a slight decrease of EC is observed in summer, leading to higher OC/EC ratios. The mean value of the OC/EC ratio is 4.9. Daily patterns show maximum EC and OC associated to traffic rush hours, with a delay of the OC peak related to the formation of SOC. Daily oscillation is more pronounced in winter. Hourly estimations of SOC production have been obtained by the primary OC/EC ratio approach, after discounting the OC, EC background contamination. A mean primary ratio value of 0.59 has been used for SOC short-term estimations throughout the entire time period. As expected, the highest SOC production is observed in summer, related to the increasing in photochemical activity, which also influences daily patterns and the time of the daily SOC maximum.

Concentrations of PCBs were below the EAC (environmental assessment criteria) for all bar one congener in one sample, and below the BAC (background assessment concentration) for most. PBDE concentrations in the sea lochs are comparable with those found at remote sites around Scotland and comparable with the lower end of concentrations found in the more industrialised Firth of Clyde.

The results demonstrated that mixing BSO with an aqueous solution of RhB (20 mg/L) resulted in rapid decolorization (pseudo-first-order kinetic constant k = 0.5594 min−1) and formation of several small molecular weight products.

Interaction of DOM with minerals and metals results in sorptive fractionation and stabilization of OM within the soil profile. Iron and aluminum oxides, in particular, have a significant effect on the quantity and quality of DOM transported through forest soils due to their high surface area and the toxic effects of dissolved aluminum on microbial communities. We directly examined these interactions by incubating forest floor material, including native microbiota, for 154 days in the presence of (1) goethite (α-FeOOH), (2) gibbsite (γ-Al(OH)3), and (3) quartz (α-SiO2) sand (as a control). Changes in molecular and thermal properties of water extractable organic matter (WEOM, as a proxy for DOM) were evaluated. WEOM was harvested on days 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 154, and examined by thermogravimetry/differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA) and diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared (DRIFT) spectroscopy. Results indicated significant differences in WEOM quality among treatments, though the way in which oxide surfaces influenced WEOM properties did not seem to change significantly with increasing incubation time. Dissolved organic C concentrations were significantly lower in WEOM from the oxide treatments in comparison to the control treatment. Incubation with goethite produced WEOM with mid-to-high-range thermal lability that was depleted in both protein and fatty acids relative to the control. The average enthalpy of WEOM from the goethite treatment was significantly higher than either the gibbsite or control treatment, suggesting that interaction with goethite surfaces increases the energy content of WEOM. Incubation with gibbsite produced WEOM rich in thermally recalcitrant and carboxyl-rich compounds in comparison to the control treatment. These data indicate that interaction of WEOM with oxide surfaces significantly influences the composition of WEOM and that oxides play an important role in determining the biogeochemistry of forest soil DOM.",,,,0.0,,

It simplifies the complex interactions of phase equilibria, jet fluid dynamics and mass transfer by two characteristic and competing times. One of them characterizes the time for the disappearance of the interface between the liquid and the fluid phase (liquid/fluid interface) where the fluid phase is represented either by a liquid or by a sc fluid phase depending on the pressure and the mixture composition. The second one is the time for particle precipitation. This description is experimentally supported by the investigation of the SAS process at various process conditions using in situ light scattering measurements which allow the access to both, to the liquid/fluid (droplets) and to the solid/fluid (particles) interface. SAS experiments were conducted by injecting the solution – yttrium acetate dissolved in dimetylsulfoxide – into the antisolvent carbon dioxide with different flow rates at a constant carbon dioxide molar fraction. The variation of the liquid flow rate did not affect the morphology of the precipitate. As a consequence, the occurrence of nano particles, micro particles and expanded micro particles can be assigned to the precipitation of the particles from a single-phase mixture, a two-phase mixture of short lifetime and a two-phase mixture of long lifetime, respectively.

The effect of a harmful or toxic algal diet on zooplankton nutrient regeneration, however, has not been previously examined. In this study, we determined the effects of non-bloom and bloom concentrations of non-toxic and toxic cultures of HAB species Prorocentrum minimum and Karlodinium veneficum on grazing and production of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrogen (DON), and phosphorus (DOP), and inorganic nutrients, ammonium (NH4+) and phosphate (PO43−), by the copepod Acartia tonsa and the heterotrophic dinoflagellate Oxyrrhis marina. Ingestion rates of grazers were significantly higher while feeding on bloom algal concentrations compared to non-bloom algal concentrations, but were always below 1% body C d−1 for A. tonsa (ingestion rate range of 0.5–31 ng C individual−1 d−1) and below 2% body C d−1 for O. marina (range of 0.1–8.8 pg C individual−1 d−1). However, rates of inorganic nutrient and dissolved organic matter (DOM) release, when detected, were always >100% of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) ingested. Additionally, the quantity and forms (organic vs. inorganic) of nutrients released by zooplankton were significantly different between non-toxic and toxic algal treatments, and typically higher grazer DOM release occurred while feeding on toxic algal cultures. DOM was the only detected form of nutrient released from O. marina, and DON and DOP were significant portions of total dissolved N and P released for A. tonsa feeding on toxic K. veneficum (69–84% and 73%, respectively). Low grazing rates on all algal diets used in our study, regardless of cell concentration or toxicity, likely resulted in starvation and subsequent catabolism of grazer body tissue. The potential for additional factors affecting variable grazer nutrient release between toxic and non-toxic algal treatments, including algal nutrient quality and direct toxic effects, are discussed. Our results suggest these grazers may not be capable of controlling bloom formation of these HAB species, and that nutrient cycling dynamics in the coastal ocean may change with increases in the presence of harmful and toxic algal blooms.",,,,0.0,,

In a previous study it was shown that amorphous SiO2 NPs of 12.5 and 27.0 nm are stable in algal growth inhibition assays and that their ecotoxic effects are related to NP surface area. Here, it was hypothesized and demonstrated that an alumina coating completely alters the particle–particle, particle–test medium and particle–algae interactions of SiO2 NPs. Therefore, stability and surface characteristics, dissolution, nutrient adsorption and effects on algal growth rate of both alumina coated SiO2 NPs and bare SiO2 NPs in OECD algal test medium as a function of pH (6.0–8.6) and natural organic matter (NOM) contents (0–12 mg C/l) were investigated. Alumina coated SiO2 NPs aggregated in all media and adsorbed phosphate depending on pH and NOM concentration. On the other hand, no aggregation or nutrient adsorption was observed for the bare SiO2 NPs. Due to their positive surface charge, alumina coated SiO2 NPs agglomerated with Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata. Consequently, algal cell density measurements based on cell counts were unreliable and hence fluorescent detection of extracted chlorophyll was the preferred method. Alumina coated SiO2 NPs showed lower toxicity than bare SiO2 NPs at concentrations ≥ 46 mg/l, except at pH 6.0. At low concentrations, no clear pH effect was observed for alumina coated SiO2 NPs, while at higher concentrations phosphate deficiency could have contributed to the higher toxicity of those particles at pH 6.0–6.8 compared to higher pH values. Bare SiO2 NPs were not toxic at pH 6.0 up to 220 mg/l. Addition of NOM decreased toxicity of both particles. For SiO2 NPs the 48 h 20% effect concentration of 21.8 mg/l increased 2.6–21 fold and a linear relationship was observed between NOM concentration and effective concentrations. No effect was observed for alumina coated SiO2 NPs in presence of NOM up to 1000 mg/l. All experiments point out that the alumina coating completely altered NP interactions. Due to the difference in surface composition the SiO2 NPs, which had the smallest surface area, were more toxic to the alga than the alumina coated SiO2 NPs.

In this study, we propose a new isotherm equation, the Shell Adsorption Model (SAM), to explain the higher adsorption capacity on smaller adsorbent particles and to describe quantitatively adsorption isotherms of activated carbons of different particle sizes: PAC and SPAC. The SAM was verified with the experimental data of PSS adsorption kinetics as well as equilibrium. SAM successfully characterized PSS adsorption isotherm data for SPACs and PAC simultaneously with the same model parameters.

The dye cations were embedded in the films based on layered silicate laponite (Lap) with the thickness of several μm. Optically homogeneous films were prepared directly from dye/Lap colloids. Dye concentration in the films was high enough for FRET to occur but sufficiently low to prevent the formation of large amounts of molecular aggregates. The films were characterized by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies, and their optical properties were compared with colloid precursors and dye aqueous solutions. The phenomenon of FRET was confirmed by means of steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopies. Significant quenching of ED emission in favor of the luminescence from EA molecules was observed. FRET led to the decrease in the lifetimes of excited states of ED molecules. Molecular orientation of dye molecules was determined by polarized absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies. Almost parallel orientation with respect to silicate surface (∼30°) was determined for all fluorescent species of the dyes.

Nanoparticles of ZnO were placed on a MALDI sample plate. Free fatty acids and derivatives were used as models of organic compounds and directly deposited on the surface of ZnO nanoparticles. Irradiation of UV laser (λ = 355 nm) with energy more than the band gap of ZnO produces ions that can be detected in negative mode. When TiO2 nanoparticles with similar band gap but much lower electron mobility were used, these ions were not observed unless the voltage on the sample plate was increased. The experimental results indicate that laser induced electron tunneling is dependent on the electron mobility and the strength of the electric field. Capture of low energy electrons by charge-deficient atoms of adsorbed organic molecules causes unpaired electron-directed cleavages of chemical bonds in a nonergodic pathway.

In a follow up study reported here, a mixture of MEH–PPV and cresyl violet in benzene at different ratios were prepared. The results showed that when the mixture was pumped by the third harmonic of Nd: YAG (355 nm), MEH–PPV as a part of the mixture could get excited by pump laser pulse excitation, and transfer its excitation energy externally to cresyl violet to produce ASE.

The experiment was conducted using nanoparticles with 5 nm and 100 nm diameters that were welded with a Nd:YAG laser. The microstructure and mechanical properties of the specimens welded using inserts with different sizes of nanoparticles and without an insert material, were examined. Electron probe micro-analyzer (EPMA) analysis was conducted to confirm the existence of Ag in the welded area. The introduction of the Ag nanoparticle insert promoted large area of fine grain and broadened the acceptable range of scanning speed parameters compared to welds without an insert. Welds with 5 nm nanoparticles yielded the highest fracture load of up to 818 N while the lowest fracture load was found for weld specimens with 100 nm nanoparticles. This lower fracture load was due to larger voids and a smaller throat length, which contributed to a lower fracture load when using larger nanoparticles.",,,,0.0,,

It is usually necessary to pattern ITO thin films to create functional structures for specific applications. Direct-write micro-patterning of ITO thin films by ultra-short pulse lasers has demonstrated high quality without requiring multiple processing stations, compared with conventional patterning technologies (e.g. wet-etch lithography). However, the processing efficiency and throughput with a single beam can be insufficient because of the high level of attenuation needed for the output to meet the required ‘thermal-free’ parameters. In this paper, high throughput surface direct micro-structuring of ITO on glass is demonstrated by parallel processing using diffractive multiple ultrashort pulse laser beams (λ = 1064 nm, τp = 10 ps). By avoiding periodic and symmetrical geometry design, the diffractive multiple beam pattern generated by a spatial light modulator has high uniformity (the energy variation between each diffractive beam is <9%). The ITO thin film is removed by laser ablation of 25 identical beams at the same time without any damage to the glass substrate.

The fluorine doping does not modify the film transparency (T≈90%), whereas for a high fluorine content, a large haze effect is observed. Such effects are associated with increased surface roughness. The Hall effect measurements show a beneficial effect with the addition of F corresponding to a decrease in resistivity for ZOF thin films accounting for oxygen to fluorine substitution in the ZnO structure. In contrast, attempts at annealing in air of successfully deposited pure ZnF2 thin films does not lead to increased conductivity in the films; this is associated with a progressive transformation from ZnF2 to ZnO. Finally, improvements in the electrical properties are proposed for F and Si co-doping, and resistivities as low as 7.2×10−4 Ω cm for SZOF thin films deposited at RT from a ZnO (87 at%)–ZnF2 (10 at%)–SiO2 (3 at%) target are achieved.",,,,0.0,,

The LFMA properties of the films were investigated as a function of DC field, temperature, microwave power and the orientation of DC field with respect to the film surface. The LFMA signal is very strong when the DC field is parallel to the film surface and vanishes at higher angles. The LFMA signal strength increases as the microwave power is increased. The LFMA signal disappears around 340 K, which can be attributed to the disappearance of ferromagnetic state well above room temperature in these films. We believe that domain structure evolution in low fields, which in turn modifies the low field permeability as well as the anisotropy, could be the origin of the LFMA observed in these films. The observation of LFMA opens the possibility of the FeSi films to be used as low magnetic field sensors in the microwave and rf frequency regions.",,,,0.0,,

The pigmented binder was then mixed with metallic zinc to formulate anticorrosive inorganic zinc silicate paint. The resultant coatings were characterized for various physical, surface, mechanical and chemical resistance properties such as drying, hardness, adhesion (cross hatch) and solvent resistance. Corrosion resistance properties were analyzed by means of salt spray, open circuit potential (OCP) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results revealed that the physical, mechanical, chemical and anticorrosive properties of the coating hydrolyzed with hydrochloric acid and oxalic acid are comparable. Thus, a chloride free biodegradable organic acid hydrolyzed inorganic zinc silicate primer is reported and due to its long term stability same also can be scaled up commercially.",,,,0.0,,

On other substrates, thin films have been used as barriers to corrosion. Here, the formation of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on the CuNi metal oxide surface has been investigated. Stable, well-ordered SAMs of octadecylphosphonic acid (ODPA) and 16-phosphonohexadecanoic acid (COOH-PA) were formed on the metal oxide surface of CuNi foils (55% Cu/45% Ni) using a solution deposition method. The ODPA modified surfaces could be used to provide a non-reactive barrier that inhibits corrosion of the CuNi metal oxide surface. Meanwhile, COOH-PA films could be used for further surface reactions such as surface initiated polymerization, in which polymer coatings are grown directly from a well-ordered film. Film-modified surfaces were characterized using diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy, contact angle analysis, and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry.

In this work, by arranging the blue light-emitting layer as a shared layer for all sub-pixels, we demonstrate that a full color display can be achieved by two FMM processes, thus reducing one FMM process compared to conventional method. The red, green and blue sub-pixels can be optimized independently despite the reduction of one FMM process. Also, the performance of the red and green sub-pixels is not degraded by the shared blue light-emitting layer.

Hybrid solar cells combine organic and inorganic materials with the aim of utilising the low cost cell production of organic photovoltaics (OPV) as well as obtaining other advantages, such as tuneable absorption spectra, from the inorganic component. Whilst hybrid solar cells have the potential to achieve high power conversion efficiencies (PCE), currently obtained efficiencies are quite low. The design of the inorganic material used as the electron acceptor in hybrid solar cells, particularly the electronic structure, is crucial to the performance of the device. There exists an optimal electronic structure design for an inorganic acceptor. To date, four major material types have been investigated, being cadmium compounds, silicon, metal oxide nanoparticles and low band gap nanoparticles. Currently, Cadmium Sulfide (CdS) quantum dots represent the state of the art, yielding a PCE of greater than 4%. This review compares the electronic structure of these materials with the optimal design components of an inorganic material and also explores possible limitations to the PCE of these devices, such as nanomorphology control and nanoparticle surface chemistry. This report provides the reader with a concise synthesis of the current state of the art for bulk heterojunction organic—inorganic hybrid solar cells. Additionally, it highlights key research areas which require attention to allow for the commercialisation of this technology.",,,,0.0,,

However, to date, the efficiencies of nanoparticulate-based devices have been inferior to that of the corresponding bulk-heterojunction devices. Here we present an approach for producing optimised OPV devices from polymer nanoparticles via the fabrication of multilayered device architectures. We show that by controlling both nanoparticle morphology and inter-particle interactions it is now possible to build polyfluorene OPV devices from aqueous dispersions of nanoparticles that are more efficient than the corresponding bulk heterojunction devices. In particular we show that: (1) the polyfluorene nanoparticle morphology is suited to effective charge separation, (2) thermal treatment of the deposited layers results in improved interparticle connectivity and effective charge transport, and (3) the optimal device thickness is a delicate balance between the repair of layer defects and the creation of stress cracking in the nanoparticulate film.

The rise time τr of the transient electroluminescence (TEL) increases linearly with increasing value of the ratio of voltage V to the current j, that is, with V/j. Using the equations for the dynamics of charge carriers an expression is derived for the rise time τr of the TEL in OLEDs. It is shown that τr should increase with increasing values of the ratio (V/j), dielectric constant ε, and area of cross-section of the emission layer, however, it should decrease with the thickness of emission layer. For higher values of the applied voltage nonlinearity occurs in the τr versus V/j plot because the increase in mobility of carriers at high electric field causes increase in the current flowing through the OLEDs. In fact, the rise time of TEL is related to the product of capacitance and effective resistance of the OLED. Considering the rate of generation and decay of radiative triplet excitons in the emission layer, an expression is derived for the decay time of TEL in PHOLEDs and it is shown that, for higher values of the time-constant of OLED, the decay time should be equal to the time-constant, however, for lower values of the time-constant, the decay time should be equal to the lifetime of radiative triplet excitons in the emission layer.

This is due to a conformational switch (trans-form to cis-form) in the HMOS molecules, which reduces the strength of the hydrophobic interaction between the HMOS molecules and the isopropyl moieties within the microgel network.

Raman spectroscopic analysis of the feedstock-pyrolysate revealed that with increased level of thermal alteration the R1 parameter (also known as the ID/IG and D/O ratio) increased in value. This appears to be a phenomena unique to low levels of thermal alteration and is most easily observed in homogeneous materials. An empirically derived kinetic model of the rise of the R1 parameter was obtained from the experimental data and used to successfully reproduce field measurements and experimental work from a number of short duration high temperature heating events. Results indicate that the use of this parameter and its predictor equation are limited to levels of thermal alteration less than that associated with the end of the oil window and the onset of condensate formation. It is also limited to situations where durations of heating are short.

In this case study, a paired-site approach was used to determine the differences in the SOC and SIC stock in the topsoil and subsoil, respectively, between a black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) forest site (converted from cropland 30 years ago) and a cropland site in the middle of the Loess Plateau of China. Compared with the cropland, the SOC stock was significantly greater under the forest in both the top 20 cm and the subsoil (30–60 cm layer). The annual litter input under the forest was more than twice that of the cropland, and the fine root biomass was significantly higher in the forest. We conclude that the higher litter input and fine root biomass may partly contribute to the greater SOC in the forest. In addition, the soil nitrogen (N) content changed in synchronicity with SOC during afforestation, which indicates that SOC accumulation in the top/subsoil may be determined by the increase in soil N in these layers. In contrast, the SIC stock in the top 20 cm of the forest was significantly lower than that of the cropland. However, this decrease in the SIC level in the topsoil of the forest was offset by an increase in SIC in the subsoil (60–100 cm). The change in SIC along the soil profile following afforestation could be explained by the dissolution and leaching of SIC from the topsoil and subsequent precipitation in the subsoil. The dissolution and leaching of SIC in the forest topsoil were due to the high biological activity associated with the high aboveground litter input, fine root biomass and SOC stock as well as the high soil water content, whereas the precipitation of the leached SIC in the subsoil was a result of the dramatic decrease in the soil water content and fine root biomass in the subsoil. These findings suggest that soil can accumulate organic carbon in the topsoil and subsoil following black locust plantation establishment on cropland (as in the Loess Plateau study area) and that this type of cropland to forest plantation conversion in this area can redistribute SIC along the soil profile without affecting the net SIC accumulation.",,,,0.0,,

Despite its distinct substrate specificity from the classic nucleoside transporters ENT1 and 2, PMAT appears to share similar protein architecture with ENT1/2 and retains low affinity binding to classic ENT inhibitors such as nitrobenzylmercaptopurine riboside (NBMPR) and the coronary vasodilators dilazep and dipyridamole. Here we investigated the role of residue Ile89, a position known to be important for ENT interaction with dilazep, dipyridamole, and nucleoside substrates, in PMAT transport function and its interaction with classic ENT inhibitors using Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells stably expressing human PMAT. Substitution of Ile89 in PMAT with Met, the counterpart residue in ENT1, resulted in normal plasma membrane localization and protein expression. Transport kinetic analysis revealed that I89M mutant had a 2.7-fold reduction in maximal transport velocity (Vmax) with no significant change in apparent binding affinity (Km) towards the prototype PMAT substrate 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), suggesting that I89 is an important determinant for the catalytic activity of PMAT. Dose-dependent inhibition studies further showed that the I89M mutation significantly increased PMAT's sensitivity to dilazep by 2.5-fold without affecting its sensitivity to dipyridamole and NBMPR. Located at the extracellular end of transmembrane domain 1 of PMAT, I89 may occupy an important position close to the substrate permeation pathway and may be involved in direct interaction with the vasodilator dilazep.",,,,0.0,,

Our results reveal that decomposition of H2O2(aq) in presence of magnetite follows pseudo first order kinetics, highly enhanced relative to the homogeneous H2O2(aq)–HCOOOH(aq)–H2O system, which possibly reflect synthesis of hydroxyl radicals (OH) through Fenton processes. The kinetic rate constants of HCOOH(aq) decarboxylation to CO2(aq) are also elevated relative to those previously measured in H2O2(aq) free experiments. However, reaction kinetics are slightly slower in the case of H2O2(aq) aqueous solutions coexisting with magnetite than in the absence of mineral phases.

The surface acidities are measured by non-aqueous titration of n-butyl amine in acetonitrile and FTIR spectra of chemisorbed pyridine. The acidity and the textural parameters of the nanocomposites can be controlled simply by changing the loading of HPW on the MCM-41.

The high saturation coverage is indicative of the well-dispersion of HPW within the mesochannels of MCM-41.

Both the surface acidity and the catalytic activity sharply increase with the modification of MCM-41 by HPW. The sample with 60 wt% HPW shows the highest acidity and catalytic activity.

Time corrected lead analyses for pairs of deciduous molars confirmed that between-tooth variation for the same child was negligible and that meaningful exposure histories can be obtained from a single, multi-point ablation transect on longitudinal sections of individual teeth.

Secondly, layer-by-layer adsorption of polyelectrolytes to the laser surface, up to a thickness of ≈45 nm, was measured. The experimental results from both assays are compared to, and shown to agree with, a theoretical model. Organic semiconductor lasers of this type have a number of attractions including ease of large-scale fabrication, incorporation into existing assay equipment and no rigid optical alignment constraints for excitation and collection of emission, which makes them well-suited to sensing applications.

The laser treatments were performed by means of a Nd:YAG laser system (λ = 266 nm, τ = 3 ns, ν = 10 Hz). The influence of processing parameters such as the laser fluence, number of pulses and substrate temperature on the morphology, surface roughness and composition of the irradiated material was studied and correlated with the optical properties and thermochemical characteristics of the propionate precursors. We conclude that the metal organic decomposition proceeds both from direct optical absorption of the precursor film and from the heating effect associated to the optical absorption of the YSZ substrate. FTIR spectra allow us to define the laser irradiation conditions where a full elimination of the organic precursors is achieved. After the metal organic precursor decomposition, we investigated the thin films crystallization process through furnace annealing. Our analyses demonstrate that through an optimized laser treatment and a furnace heating process it is possible to create epitaxial 20 nm-thick CZO films, with similar nanostructure and surface flatness than in conventional thermal treatments but with an important saving of processing time and an enhanced versatility to define micrometric patterns.",,,,0.0,,

The results were compared to the laboratory standard technique, e.g., combustion on a LECO-CN analyzer, to determine the true values for total C, inorganic C, and organic C concentrations. Our objectives were: 1) to determine the characteristic spectra of soils containing different amounts of organic and inorganic C, and 2) to examine the viability of this technique for differentiating between soils that contain predominantly organic and/or inorganic C content for a range of diverse soils. Previous work has shown that LIBS is an accurate and reliable approach to measuring total carbon content of soils, but it remains uncertain whether inorganic and organic forms of carbon can be separated using this approach. Total C and inorganic C exhibited correlation with rock-forming elements such as Al, Si, Fe, Ti, Ca, and Sr, while organic C exhibited minor correlation with these elements and a major correlation with Mg. We calculated a figure of merit (Mg/Ca) based on our results to enable differentiation between inorganic versus organic C.

This paper is focused in molecular emission of LIBS plasmas based on the CN (B2Σ–X2Σ) band, one of the strongest emissions appearing in all carbon materials when analyzed in air atmosphere. An analysis of this band with sufficient spectral resolution provides a great deal of information on the molecule, which has revealed that valuable information can be obtained from the plume chemistry and dynamics affecting the excitation mechanisms of the molecules. The vibrational emission of this molecular band has been investigated to establish the dependence of this emission on the molecular structure of the materials. The paper shows that excitation/emission phenomena of molecular species observed in the plume depend strongly on the time interval selected and on the irradiance deposited on the sample surface. Precise time resolved LIBS measurements are needed for the observation of distinctive CN emission. For the organic compounds studied, larger differences in the behavior of the vibrational emission occur at early stages after plasma ignition. Since molecular emission is generally more complex than that involving atomic emission, local plasma conditions as well as plume chemistry may induce changes in vibrational emission of molecules.

Experiments were conducted at Ponta Grossa (PG) in Paraná State and Lucas do Rio Verde (LRV) in Mato Grosso State of Brazil. Laser-induced fluorescence (LIFS) and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopies, were used on whole soil samples to 1-m depth, and on seven aggregate size classes (8–19, 4–8, 2–4, 1–2, 0.5–1, 0.25–0.5, 0.053–0.25 mm) obtained by wet sieving of 0–5 and 5–10 cm layers. Three functional C groups were selected based on FTIR: aliphatic-C1 (1404 cm− 1), aromatic-C (1632 cm− 1), and aliphatic-C2 (2852 and 2922 cm− 1). The HLIF was 3 to 5 times higher at the LRV site than at PG at all soil depths, indicating that selective preservation by aromaticity of SOM is the predominant mechanism in this environment. Relatively lower HFIL was observed in NT soils at both locations because of aggregation which protects most labile moieties. The depletion of C concentration in CT was related to the decrease in functional C groups (i.e., aromatic-C and aliphatic-C) and an overall increase in the humification degree, indicating that physical protection mechanisms are not sufficient to protect the labile fractions of OM. In contrast, the intensity of functional C groups under NT systems was similar to that in the soil under NV at both locations. A discriminant analysis of principal components clearly showed that soils at both locations can be clustered into three groups, corresponding to the three main land-use and management practices. Thus, soils under NV, NT, and CT differed significantly in terms of the composition of organic compounds, and in the interactions between inorganic and organic fractions. Land use changes modify the arrangement of organic compounds necessitating the diversification of agroecosystems and conversion to NT farming.

The scheme essentially involves the pinching of glass tube in such a way that smooth profile for liquid flow exists near the optical pumping region. This ensures the minimization of dye solution flow induced instabilities near the dye laser axis. The performance of this dye cell was evaluated by using it in a dye laser system having narrow linewidth dispersive resonator, pumped by a high repetition rate copper vapor laser, by means of the Fabry–Perot interferometer setup.

With a combination of optimized thickness of the first cap layer and elevated growth temperature for the second cap layer, it is found that the photoluminescence (PL) linewidth of QDs can be significantly reduced from 124 meV to 87 meV at room temperature (RT). This reduction in PL linewidth is likely to be due to the enhanced As/P exchange reaction and indium migration at high growth temperature, which lead to a more uniform QD height distribution. Moreover, the uniformity of the PL peak intensity and peak energy on the wafer surface is evidently improved due to the higher material quality achieved when an elevated temperature is used for the SCL growth.",,,,0.0,,

Four proteins with very different structures and properties were investigated – equine heart cytochrome c (Cyt c; 12.4 kDa), recombinant human growth hormone expressed in Escherichia coli (hGH; 22 kDa), urinary follicle stimulating hormone (FSH; 30 kDa) and FITC-labelled bovine serum albumin (FITC-BSA; 70 kDa). The transport experiments were performed using a scanning Er:YAG diode pumped laser (P.L.E.A.S.E.®; Precise Laser Epidermal System). The distribution of FITC-BSA in the micropores following P.L.E.A.S.E.® poration was visualised by using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Porcine skin was used for the device parameter and CLSM studies; its validity as a model was confirmed by subsequent comparison with transport of Cyt c and FITC-BSA across P.L.E.A.S.E.® porated human skin. No protein transport (deposition or permeation) was observed across intact skin; however, P.L.E.A.S.E.® poration enabled total delivery after 24 h of 48.2 ± 8.9, 8.1 ± 4.2, 0.2 ± 0.1 and 273.3 ± 30.6 μg/cm2 for Cyt c, hGH, FSH and FITC-BSA, respectively, using 900 pores/135.9 cm2. Calculation of permeability coefficients showed that there was no linear dependence of transport on molecular weight ((1.6 ± 0.3), (0.1 ± 0.05), (0.08 ± 0.03) and (0.9 ± 0.1) × 10−3 cm/h, for Cyt c, hGH, FSH and FITC-BSA, respectively); indeed, a U-shaped curve was observed. This suggested that molecular weight was not a sufficiently sensitive descriptor and that transport was more likely to be determined by the surface properties of the respective proteins since these would govern interactions with the local microenvironment. Increasing pore density (i.e. the number of micropores per unit area) had a statistically significant effect on the cumulative permeation of both Cyt c (at 100, 150, 300 and 600 pores/cm2, permeation was 11.2 ± 2.4, 15.3 ± 11.8, 33.8 ± 10.5 and 51.2 ± 15.8 4 μg/cm2, respectively) and FITC-BSA (at 50, 100, 150 and 300 pores/cm2, it was 58.5 ± 15.3, 132.6 ± 40.0, 192.7 ± 24.4, 293.3 ± 76.5 μg/cm2, respectively). Linear relationships were established in both cases. However, only the delivery of FITC-BSA was improved upon increasing fluence (53.3 ± 22.5, 293.3 ± 76.5, 329.6 ± 11.5 and 222.1 ± 29.4 μg/cm2 at 22.65, 45.3, 90.6 and 135.9 J/cm2, respectively). The impact of fluence – and hence pore depth – on transport will depend on the relative diffusivities of the protein in the micropore and in the ‘bulk’ epidermis/dermis. Experiments with Cyt c and FSH confirmed that delivery was dependent upon concentration, and it was shown that therapeutic delivery of the latter was feasible. Cumulative permeation of Cyt c and FITC-BSA was also shown to be statistically equivalent across porcine and human skin. In conclusion, it was demonstrated that laser microporation enabled protein delivery into and across the skin and that this could be modulated via the poration parameters and was also dependent upon the concentration gradient in the pore. However, the role of protein physicochemical properties and their influence on transport rates remains to be elucidated and will be explored in future studies.",,,,0.0,,

Laser induced breakdown spectroscopy is a serious candidate to address this challenge and is especially well suited for multi-elemental analysis of heavy metals. However, saturation and matrix effects prevent from a simple treatment of the LIBS data, namely through a regular calibration curve. This paper details the limits of this approach and consequently emphasizes the advantage of using artificial neural networks well suited for non-linear and multi-variate calibration. This advanced method of data analysis is evaluated in the case of real soil samples and on-site LIBS measurements. The selection of the LIBS data as input data of the network is particularly detailed and finally, resulting errors of prediction lower than 20% for aluminum, calcium, copper and iron demonstrate the good efficiency of the artificial neural networks for on-site quantitative LIBS of soils.",,,,0.0,,

The fly ash consists of oxides (SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3, CaO, and so on), unburned carbon, and other minor elements. Recently laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) technique has been applied to coal combustion and other industrial fields because of the fast response, high sensitivity, real-time and non-contact features. In these applications it is important to measure controlling factors without any sample preparation to maintain the real-time measurement feature. The relation between particle content and particle diameter is also one of the vital researches, because compositions of particles are dependent on their diameter.

Particles were classified by an Anderson cascade impactor and their contents were measured using the output of 1064 nm YAG laser, a spectrograph and an ICCD camera. The plasma conditions such as plasma temperature are dependent on the size of particles and these effects must be corrected to obtain quantitative information. The plasma temperature was corrected by the emission intensity ratio from the same atom. Using this correction method, the contents of particles can be measured quantitatively in fixed experimental parameters. This method was applied to coal and fly ash from a coal-fired burner to measure unburned carbon and other contents according to the particle diameter.

The pH-dependent charge state of MNPs was characterized by electrophoretic mobility and their aggregation by dynamic light scattering.

Comprehensive analysis of our experimental data suggest that at low temperature, in the VRH hopping regime (5–50 K), spin relaxation due to hyperfine interaction and Elliot-Yafet momentum scattering is the dominant spin relaxation mechanism while in the thermally activated regime Dyakonov–Perel mechanism contribution becomes significant.

StOC could be preserved at least 762 kyr in both loess and paleosol under burial condition. (2) The TOC was positively correlated with clay contents, with correlation coefficients of 0.72 (Baoji) and 0.63 (Luochuan). (3) The TOC, StOC, mineral-protected organic carbon (MOC), and recalcitrant organic carbon (ROC) were positively correlated with kaolinite, with correlation coefficients of 0.93, 0.72, 0.52, 0.81 (Baoji) and 0.78, 0.58, 0.50, 0.49 (Luochuan), respectively, both with neither illite nor vermiculite. (4) The TOC was highly correlated with complex iron (Fep) with correlation coefficients of 0.90 (Baoji) and 0.82 (Luochuan), so with amorphous oxides of iron (Feo) as well. Among them, Feo mainly affected by sorption and Fep by complexation on SOC preservation, whereas kaolinite had both chemical and physical effects. The values of coefficients further highlight that the contributions of inorganic matters to the fixation of organic carbon were ranked to an order of kaolinite > Fep > Feo.",,,,0.0,,

The influence of acid treatment prior to NaOH–EDTA extraction on 31P NMR spectra was also investigated. Results show that highly resistant OP was the major class of organic P. The rank order of organic P fractions was highly resistant OP (on average accounting for 68.5% of total OP) > moderately resistant OP (15.8%m of total OP) > moderately labile OP (11.4% of total OP) > labile OP (4.3% of total OP). Most of the organic P fractions decreased with soil depth due to the accumulation of plant residues in surface soils and the deposition and diagenesis of soils. Moderately (r = 0.586, p < 0.01) and highly (r = 0.741, p < 0.01) resistant OP fractions were positively correlated with soil organic matter.

Monoester-P was the dominant soil organic P compound identified. The proportion of monoester-P increased significantly in NaOH–EDTA extracts with HCl pretreatment and it was confirmed by chemical analysis.

The qPCR protocol was used to monitor the endophytic colonization of opium poppy leaves byB. bassiana after inoculation with the strain EABb 04/01-Tip, detecting as low as 26 fg of target DNA in leaves and a decrease in fungal biomass over time.

We tested the aggregation of nC60 in wastewater at different values of pH, ionic strength, and dissolved organic matter (DOM). The nC60 remained relatively stable in filtered wastewater under environmentally relevant conditions up to 24 h. But at pH 3 or at high ionic strength (>100 mM NaCl), the aggregate size increased greatly, reaching micrometer scale after only 1 h. However, the aggregation behavior varied among wastewater samples even at values of similar zeta potential, compared with that in filtered secondary effluent and aeration tank liquor, that in filtered primary effluent was obviously inhibited. This inhibition could be attributed to the steric stabilization due to the adsorption of DOM on nC60 aggregate in addition to electrostatic stabilization. The aggregation results also suggest that membrane filtration could be improved by adjustments to pH.",,,,0.0,,

Current assay methods for discovery of APH3′IIIa inhibitors suffer from low specificity and high false positive/negative hit rates. Here, we describe a method for screening APH3′IIIa inhibitors based on direct detection of kanamycin A phosphorylation using MALDI-MS/MS, which is more rapid than conventional assays and does not require secondary assays or sample cleanup. The MALDI-MS/MS assay operates at an ionic strength of 45 mM and co-factors can be utilized at near-physiological levels for optimal enzyme activity. Detection via MALDI-MS/MS allowed for improved reproducibility when compared to ESI-MS/MS. Furthermore, the use of MS/MS provided better signal-to-noise ratios relative to MS alone on the MALDI instrument. The assay was validated via generation of Z′-factors, with values of 0.78 and 0.56 in the absence and presence of 0.2% DMSO, respectively.

The binaries are direct-gap semiconductors with respective bandgaps of 6.1 eV for AlN, 3.4 eV for GaN, and ∼0.6 eV for InN, and adopt the hexagonal wurtzite crystal structure. The nitrides form continuous solid solutions, and are capable of being both n- and p-doped, thus making possible the growth of advanced heterostructure devices exemplified by GaN-based visible light-emitting diodes. Interest in nitride MOVPE from the late 1980s motivated significant work on single-source precursors, and also thermally labile nitrogen sources for use in two-source processes. The best developed of the former are azido compounds, which can have properties well tailored for low-temperature film deposition. However, the nitride MOVPE processes that have come to dominate device manufacturing since the mid-1990s depend on the reaction between ammonia and metal alkyl sources, and deposit GaN at temperatures usually above 1000 °C. Most current nitride growth is performed heteroepitaxially on sapphire (0 0 0 1) substrates, for which appropriate multistep growth initiation processes have been optimised. Current designs of nitride MOVPE reactor are engineered to avoid premature contact between the group 13 sources and ammonia, and feature in situ monitoring by optical means. The mechanisms of the growth chemistry are now understood to the extent that they are handled explicitly in multi-scale computational simulations of full processes. Particular recent advances in mechanistic understanding concern the role of nanoparticles that form in the gas phase, and which represent an important precursor loss channel. Methodologies for controlling the composition and properties of layers of GaN itself, and of ternary alloy layers with moderate (<25 mole%) contents of InN or AlN, are well established. However, greater challenges are posed by growth of layers InN, AlN, and of alloys close to these two binaries in composition. New variants of MOVPE continue to be explored as a consequence, and include processes with pulsed alternating precursor introduction to enhance lateral migration of adatoms on the surface of the growing film. A further important new emphasis in recent years is the controlled growth of nanowire and nanorod arrays, which already include core-shell heterostructures of considerable sophistication.",,,,0.0,,

This organic matter evolves from molecular clouds to protoplanetary disks, and as a final destination, takes part in the formation of many objects of our solar system, such as primitive chondritic material, planetesimals and finally planets. In this contribution, we perform experimental simulations based on the VUV irradiation and warming-up of primitive interstellar ice analogs (CH3OH:NH3:H2O), and characterize, for the first time, the resulting refractory residue, using very high resolution mass spectrometry (VHRMS) with an LTQ-orbitrap-XL instrument. An electrospray source allows ionizing all the molecules having proton donor or acceptor chemical functions, while limiting as much as possible their damages. Thus, this method provides the analysis of the whole ionizable molecules making up the residue. The analysis of the spectra shows that these residues contain a large number of molecules formed of CHNO elements, including macromolecular entities beyond 4000 Da. The average elemental composition of the residue is of H/C = 1.5, N/C = 0.4, O/C = 0.4. These first results are tentatively compared to VHRMS analyses of the soluble organic matter (SOM) present in the Murchison’s meteorite, a primitive chondrite of the CM class. The molecular richness observed can be considered as the “first step” of the complex abiotic organic matter in extraterrestrial media. This initial matter, that may be rather universal, could then evolve toward more processed materials in parent bodies, such as comets and asteroids, materials that are then observed and subsequently analyzed in meteorites found on Earth. In addition to providing some insight on the mixture complexity, VHRMS allows for the search of specific molecules. For instance, hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) and some of its derivatives are identified in these residues. With the possibility to characterize the whole residue as well as some specific molecules, we consider that VHRMS is a powerful analytical tool for the understanding of the chemical evolution of organic matter in astrophysical environments.",,,,0.0,,

Studies addressing the effects of climatic warming on the ecosystem total water balance are scarce, and measured warming effects on the T/ET ratio in field experiments have not been seen in the literature. In this study, we quantified T/ET ratios under ambient and warming treatments in a grassland ecosystem using a stable isotope approach. The measurements were made at a long-term grassland warming site in Oklahoma during the May–June peak growing season of 2011. Chamber-based methods were used to estimate the δ2H isotopic composition of evaporation (δE), transpiration (δT) and the aggregated evapotranspiration (δET). A modified commercial conifer leaf chamber was used for δT, a modified commercial soil chamber was used for δE and a custom built chamber was used for δET. The δE, δET and δT were quantified using both the Keeling plot approach and a mass balance method, with the Craig–Gordon model approach also used to calculate δE. Multiple methods demonstrated no significant difference between control and warming plots for both δET and δT. Though the chamber-based estimates and the Craig–Gordon results diverged by about 12‰, all methods showed that δE was more depleted in the warming plots. This decrease in δE indicates that the evaporation flux as a percentage of total water flux necessarily decreased for δET to remain constant, which was confirmed by field observations. The T/ET ratio in the control treatment was 0.65 or 0.77 and the ratio found in the warming treatment was 0.83 or 0.86, based on the chamber method and the Craig–Gordon approach. Sensitivity analysis of the Craig–Gordon model demonstrates that the warming-induced decrease in soil liquid water isotopic composition is the major factor responsible for the observed δE depletion and the temperature dependent equilibrium effects are minor.

With 13C-labeled benzoic acid as a model sample, this research utilized the LAMIS approach to clarify the formation mechanisms of C2 and CN molecules during laser ablation of organic materials. Because the isotopic ratios in the molecular bands could deviate from statistical distribution depending on their formation pathways, the dominant mechanism can be identified through a comparison of the experimental observed isotopic patterns in the molecular emission with the theoretical statistical pattern. For C2 formation, the experimental 12C12C/13C12C ratios not only support a recombination mechanism through atomic carbon at early delay time but also indicate the presence of other operating mechanisms as the plasma evolves; it is proposed that some of the C2 molecules are released directly from the aromatic ring of the sample as molecular fragments.

The luminescent spectra exhibited that the upconversion luminescence originates from the Mn2+ ions. The dependence of the fluorescence intensity on the pump power reveals that a two-photon excitation process dominates in the conversion of infrared radiation to the visible emission. It is suggested that the simultaneous absorption of two infrared photons produces the population of upper excited states, which leads to the characteristic visible emission.

The organic phases consisted of bis-(2-ethyl-hexyl) phosphoric acid (D2EHPA), bis(1,3-dibutyloxypropan-2-yl) phosphoric acid (BiDiBOPP) and synergistic mixtures of tri-n-octylphosphine oxide (TOPO) or di-n-hexyl octyl methoxy phosphine oxide (di-n-HMOPO) with D2EHPA or BiDiBOPP in Isane IP 185 (an aliphatic diluent).

This species, whose formula is likely UO2(HL)2L2TOPO with HL = monomeric D2EHPA and L = deprotonated form of D2EHPA, is characterized by the fact that the TOPO molecule is located in the first solvation shell of uranium(VI) as also confirmed by DFT calculations. Furthermore, TRLF spectra of uranium(VI) in D2EHPA/di-n-HMOPO and BiDiBOPP/di-n-HMOPO are quite different from those obtained with the D2EHPA/TOPO mixture. Indeed, the vibronic peaks of uranium(VI) TRLF spectra have partially (D2EHPA/di-n-HMOPO) or completely (BiDiBOPP/di-n-HMOPO) disappeared, which could be due to the presence of oxygen atoms in the hydrophobic chains of BiDiBOPP and di-n-HMOPO. As in the case of the D2EHPA/TOPO mixture, the fluorescence lifetime of uranium(VI) in the BiDiBOPP/di-n-HMOPO mixture indicates that uranium(VI) is extracted by this mixture from 5.3 mol.L− 1 H3PO4 as a unique or at least a predominant species.",,,,,0.0,

Theoretical analysis shows that, accompanying with the increased number of central phenyl rings, the uniform high-frequency modes (around at 1200, 1300 and 1650 cm−1) of the three compounds are enhanced, which is driven by the CH bending and CC stretching in the central phenyl rings. Correspondingly, the enhanced vibration strength of the high-frequency modes and reinforced vibronic peak intensity bring out the distinct “four-level” energy level scheme which benefits population inversion for lasing and leads to the decreased ASE threshold. These results indicate that the synthesized materials are good candidates to act as active laser materials and our work provides an insight into the lasing of small organic molecules.",,,,,2.0,

For constant deposition pressure of 5 Pa the film crystallinity is changed from preferential (002) to polycrystalline when increasing dopant concentration. For the maximum dopant concentration that we have investigated (i.e., 4.4% at.) structural properties of AZO films are changed from a polycrystalline phase to a (110) preferential orientation when the deposition pressure decreases. This uncommon growth mode is accompanied by a change of the morphology from a densely packed granular structure to a more rarefied one. Moreover, the band gap widens up to 3.88 eV and the electrical resistivity drops to 5.4 × 10− 2 Ω cm. The structural changes were attributed to two mechanisms: a first one, responsible for the (002) phase suppression as a consequence of aluminum ion bombardment during the doping process and, a second one, in charge with (110) phase growth as the diffusion rates of zinc and oxygen atoms are affected by the dopant incorporation and by the decrease of deposition pressure.",,,,,0.0,

The addition of Y2O3 refined the structure of the primary phase, improved the microstructural uniformity, and increased the volume fraction of TiC.

Analyses of the initial worn surfaces showed that the coating with Y2O3 was covered with a thin tribolayer, which consisted of Fe and its oxides. The true worn surfaces of the coating with Y2O3 were smoother than that of the coating without Y2O3 due to the protection by the tribolayer. Analyses of the cross-sections from the wear tracks revealed that the surface of the coating without Y2O3 was covered with many fine cracks which caused the debonding of the fragments from the surface of the coating.

This paper reports on enhanced photorefractive response rate through control of the photoconductivity and trapping rate in organic triphenylamine-based photorefractive materials by means of bulk state tuning. The bulk state in organic triphenylamine-based photorefractive composites was controlled through a rapid cooling process from various melting temperatures during sample fabrication.

This remarkably low J0 value corresponds to implied open-circuit voltages around 690 mV, demonstrating the high-efficiency potential of this novel junction type. However, experimentally realized organic-silicon heterojunction solar cells showed relatively moderate efficiencies so far, typically below 12%. We demonstrate in this study that these solar cells were limited by the fact that the organic-silicon junction was localized on the cell front, resulting in a significant parasitic light absorption within the PEDOT:PSS layer. In addition, the rear surface of these front-junction solar cells was either poorly passivated or not passivated at all. In this paper, we overcome these limitations by proposing a back-junction organic-silicon solar cell, the so-called “BackPEDOT” cell. We show that placing PEDOT:PSS on the rear side instead of the front surface avoids parasitic light absorption within the PEDOT:PSS and allows for an improved surface passivation. We fabricate and characterize BackPEDOT solar cells and achieve very high open-circuit voltages of up to 663 mV and short-circuit current densities of up to 39.7 mA/cm2. Despite the relatively high series resistances of our first BackPEDOT cells, we achieve an energy conversion efficiency of 17.4%.

Soft-nanoimprint lithography is employed to integrate the microstructure onto the polymer surface, which enables large area fabrication with high quality, low cost, and repeatable use of the poly(dimethylsiloxane) mold. The light extraction of the FTOLEDs has been improved by integrating the microstructure with two-dimensional tapered micropillars array on the polymer encapsulation film, which can suppress the reflection by enhancing the critical angle of total reflection owing to its gradually changed refractive index. Moreover, the microstructured surface exhibits a hydrophobic property owing to its high contact angle, which results in a self-cleaning ability to protect the FTOLEDs from being polluted by water droplets and dust particles in practical applications.",,,,,1.0,

The adsorption rate and surface coverage on TiO2 films of the co-sensitizers, i.e., a metal-free squaraine dye (SQ2) and a diarylaminofluorene-based organic dye (JD1), are also studied to explain the performance of DSSCs. The power conversion efficiency (η) of the co-sensitized DSSC is enhanced due to the cooperative interactions of the organic co-sensitizers. A wide absorption wavelength (400–750 nm) for light harvesting is found for the co-sensitizer at the molar ratio of 6 to 4 for JD1 to SQ2 dye, and thereby an η value of 6.36% is achieved for the pertinent DSSC, which is much higher than those of the cells sensitized with individual dyes absorbing narrow wavelength of light, i.e., η of 5.44% and 4.11% for the DSSC sensitized with JD1 (absorption wavelength from 400 to 550 nm) and SQ2 dye (absorption wavelength from 550 to 750 nm), respectively.",,,,,1.0,

Gaps exist in a fundamental understanding of the sources and sinks of organics and thus, knowledge needed to steer regulatory purposes is far from complete. Isotopes provide specific “fingerprints” in OTC. These fingerprints result from the isotopic composition at emission, as well as from chemical and physical processes in the atmosphere. Compound specific isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) in atmospheric OTC is therefore a promising tool to improve our understanding of sources and the atmospheric fate of OTC. Due to analytical challenges originating from the small sample amounts and a huge variety of physical and chemical properties of OTC present in the atmosphere, such measurements are not routinely performed. We present an overview of basic concepts as well as instrumental and measurement procedures used for compound specific IRMS in atmospheric OTC. Concepts for the interpretation of ambient observations are reviewed together with available literature data on source specific and ambient δ13C values of gas and particle phase OTC. Full deployment of the IRMS potential in future atmospheric studies will depend on the availability of laboratory kinetic data. Further method developments, such as increasing sensitivity and accuracy, as well as techniques for simultaneous isotope ratio measurement of multiple atoms are expected to further extend the potential use of isotope ratios for studies of atmospheric OTC.",,,,,0.0,

An innovative methodology using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CSLM) is developed to locate fluorescent CdTe quantum dots (QDs) in different depths of fouled ultrafiltration membranes. With the help of image analysis software, both qualitative and quantitative information about the distribution of QDs in membranes are obtained. For low molecular weight cut off (MWCO) membranes (1, 5 and 10 kDa), QDs (sizes from 1 to 5 nm) distributed mainly around surfaces or on top of membranes, accompanied with near 100% retention regardless of transmembrane pressure. As membrane MWCO increased (30 and 100 kDa), more QDs could pass through membranes accompanied with decreasing retention efficiencies and the occurrence of QDs was usually in deeper positions of membranes.

Such devices are often termed tandem or multi-junction solar cells. The larger number of different materials and processing steps involved in their making when compared with the single junction solar cell has to be justified and compensated by a higher efficiency. A central question to ask is how much energy you need to invest in a system in order for it to produce energy and return the investment at least once and preferably a number of times. As an initial investigation into the potential viability of the tandem or multi-junction approach we have engaged in a detailed analysis based on the manufacturing energy for each step within the tandem module supply chain for full ambient processing of thin flexible polymer tandem solar cells prepared entirely by roll processing methods. We present a comprehensive overview of relevant research results on how the energy consumption affects the energy balance when using single and multi-junction solar cells. Based on the above question we calculate the minimum efficiency that the tandem or multi-junction should present to determine the minimum energy payback time; that is whether (or when) the increase in materials use and complexity of the tandem architecture is compensated by better performance. After analysing the performance and the consideration of a series of technical improvement opportunities, we project that the tandem solar cell has to be ~20% higher performing than the corresponding single junction solar cell to be warranted. We also highlight that there is a range in the reciprocal EBPT–efficiency relationship where the tandem solar cell is an advantage. Specific to polymer and organic solar cells are however that they embody very little energy and this implies that the single junction may be an advantage, especially in cases where land mass is not critical.",,,,,0.0,

Synthesis was successful using different zeolite Beta seeds including pure silica seeds. During the induction period, the seeds underwent dissolution. The SiO2/Al2O3 ratio and crystal size, pretreatment (calcination), and seed addition time had a significant influence on seed dissolution behavior, crystallization process, and product. Morphological studies revealed that the seed residues produced by dissolution (except for pure silica) resulted in the formation of “immobilized” surface nuclei, which allowed for the dense growth of fresh small zeolite Beta crystals. The dissolved small seed fragments yielded dispersed nuclei, which formed relatively scattered small zeolite Beta crystals thought to be the main nuclei source of the pure silica seed.

The experiment was performed using two series of mesocosms: the first consisted of seawater and the second consisted of seawater enriched with humic-rich river water. We grew ice by freezing the water at an air temperature of − 14 °C for 14 days after which ice decay was induced by increasing the air temperature to − 1 °C. Using the ice temperatures and bulk ice salinities, we derived the brine volume fractions, brine salinities and Rayleigh numbers. The temporal evolution of these physical parameters indicates that there was two main stages in the brine dynamics: bottom convection during ice growth, and brine stratification during ice decay. The major findings are: (1) the incorporation of dissolved compounds (nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, phosphate, silicate, and DOC) into the sea ice was not conservative (relative to salinity) during ice growth. Brine convection clearly influenced the incorporation of the dissolved compounds, since the non-conservative behavior of the dissolved compounds was particularly pronounced in the absence of brine convection. (2) Bacterial activity further regulated nutrient availability in the ice: ammonium and nitrite accumulated as a result of remineralization processes, although bacterial production was too low to induce major changes in DOC concentrations. (3) Different forms of DOC have different properties and hence incorporation efficiencies. In particular, the terrestrially-derived DOC from the river water was less efficiently incorporated into sea ice than the DOC in the seawater. Therefore the main factors regulating the distribution of the dissolved compounds within sea ice are clearly a complex interaction of brine dynamics, biological activity and in the case of dissolved organic matter, the physico-chemical properties of the dissolved constituents themselves.",,,,,0.0,

Recently, laser ablation is a flexible and versatile technique that extensively used to synthesis of pure metal and metal oxide nanoparticles by laser target interaction in liquid carrier media. In this research pure iron and iron oxide nanoparticles were synthesized by pulsed laser ablation in deionized water and acetone. Water is the base of many chemical solution and acetone is a simple organic liquid that can employed as polymers solvent and could be mixed with many conventional organic liquids. A Q-switched Nd:YAG laser with the fundamental wavelength at 1064 nm, energy of 180 mJ/pulse and 12 ns pulse length was employed for ablation. The laser was operated at repetition rate of 10 Hz for10 min. To avoid the texturing effect and to get uniform ablation, the pure iron target was rotated manually during ablation. Particle size and morphology, crystal structure and optical properties of the nanoparticles were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and UV-visible spectroscopy respectively. In both samples the papered nanoparticles were rather spherical and the aspect ratio was close to 1. In deionized water and acetone the average particles sizes are 26 nm and 14 nm respectively.

These light-scattering devices are based upon binary mixtures that consist of an organosiloxane smectic A LC and a wide temperature range nematogen LC. Both the temperature range of the smectic A phase and the dielectric anisotropy of the binary mixture are increased compared with that of the neat organosiloxane compound. In the latter case, the increase in the dielectric anisotropy results in a reduction of the magnitude of the electric field required to induce a clear state. Furthermore, it is found that the electric field threshold continues to decrease with increasing concentration of the nematic compound. For the random laser devices, the Pyrromethene 597 laser dye was added to a mixture that was optimized for scattering and it was found that the absorption properties of the dye becomes unstable in the presence of the electro-hydrodynamic instabilities that are required to generate scattering in the LC cells. This is believed to be due to electro-chemical reactions that occur at the electrodes. To avoid dye degradation and ensure repeatable electro-optic behaviour, a reduction–oxidation (redox) couple is dispersed within the dye-doped binary mixture. It is shown that the addition of redox dopants helps to stabilize the dye in the scattering mixtures, and also increases the long-term repeatability of the scattering behaviour.

Approaches to ultimate strength and to highly nonequlibrium crystallization are tightly coupled with the smallness of spatiotemporal scales.

To use these advantages we have first of all to develop clear and reliable physical model. The paper presents new results concerning interactions of optical or X-ray lasers with metals. It is shown that ultrashort laser pulse melts surface layer, sends shock into bulk, and foams molten metal. Dense dislocation bilayer is created thanks to fast recrystallization (the first sublayer) and plastic transformations behind strong shock (the second sublayer). Plastic shock generated at moderate laser intensities attenuates sharply during its propagation into metal. During this attenuation, a plastic shock regenerates into a powerful elastic shock.

The performance of both laser sampling methods is presented. A subset of 9 black laser toners, 10 colored (CMYK) inkjet samples, 12 colored (CMYK) offset samples and 12 intaglio inks originating from different manufacturing sources were analyzed to evaluate the discrimination capability of the tandem method.

Since laser light can be manipulated very precisely, it becomes possible to engineer selective, predictive, and highly controlled interface properties. Photochemistry of organic–inorganic energetic interfaces is a rapidly emerging research field in which energy absorption and interface stability mechanisms have yet to be established. To explore the interaction of the laser irradiation with molecular materials, we performed first principle calculations of a prototype organic–inorganic interface between a nitroester (pentaerythritol tetranitrate, PETN, C5H8N4O12) and a magnesium oxide (MgO) surface. We found that the light absorption is defined by the band alignment between interface components and interfacial charge transfer coupled with electronic states in the band gap, generated by oxide surface defects. Hence the choice of an oxide substrate and its morphology makes the optical absorption tunable and governs both the energy accumulation and energy release at the interface. The obtained results offer a possible consistent interpretation of experiments on selective laser initiation of energetic materials, which reported that the presence of metal oxide additives triggered the photoinitiation by excitation energy much lower than the band gap. We suggest that PETN photodecomposition is catalyzed by oxygen vacancies (F0 centers) at the MgO surface. Our conclusions predict ways for a complete separation of thermo- and photo-stimulated interface chemistry of molecular materials, which is imperative for highly controllable fast decomposition and was not attainable before.

This reduction in efficiency resulted primarily from a reduction in PV fill factor and shunt-resistance, indicating the presence of current-shunts within the device. Using optical microscopy, laser beam induced current mapping and scanning electron microscopy, we are able to demonstrate that such current shunts are associated with micron-sized aggregates of Pd-containing nanoparticles.

Compared to other conventional joining processes, adhesive bonding offers several advantages: including acoustic insulation, vibration attenuation, structure lightening, corrosion reduction and uniform stress distribution. These benefits can be offset if the surfaces to be bonded are not carefully cleaned, degreased and prepared. Many approaches to surface treatments based on physical or chemical modifications have been developed in the years in order to improve the surface activity. Although widely used and very efficient, these techniques present several disadvantages. Physical methods based on mechanical abrasion are supposed to extend bonding area as they increase the roughness, but cause an extensive degradation to the specimens and they are often not easy to reproduce.

Furthermore, by using the dual pulses combination for three proposed conditions, extracted by semi-classical approach, the dissociation rates up to 78% is achieved.

In this study we applied matrix assisted pulsed laser evaporation (MAPLE) in order to synthesize calcium alendronate monohydrate (a bisphosphonate obtained by calcium sequestration from octacalcium phosphate by alendronate) and calcium alendronate monohydrate/octacalcium phosphate composite thin films on titanium substrates. Octacalcium phosphate coatings were prepared as reference material. The powders, which were synthesized in aqueous medium, were suspended in deionised water, frozen at liquid nitrogen temperature and used as targets for MAPLE experiments. The transfer was conducted with a KrF* excimer laser source (λ = 248 nm, τFWHM ≤ 25 ns) in mild conditions of temperature and pressure. XRD, FTIR and SEM analyses confirmed that the coatings contain the same crystalline phases as the as-prepared powder samples. Osteoblast derived from stem cells and osteoclast derived from monocytes of osteoporotic subjects were co-cultured on the coatings up to 14 days. Osteoclast displayed significantly reduced proliferation and differentiation in the presence of calcium alendronate monohydrate, pointing to a clear role of the coatings containing this bisphosphonate on inhibiting excessive bone resorption. At variance, osteoblast production of alkaline phosphatase and type I pro-collagen were promoted by the presence of bisphosphonate, which also decreased the production of interleukin 6. The positive influence towards osteoblast differentiation was even more enhanced in the composite coatings, thanks to the presence of octacalcium phosphate.",,,,,0.0,

The solidification mechanisms of the coated sands during the SLS and post-curing processes were provided, and effects of binder content, raw sand type and post-curing parameters on the strength and gas evolution were investigated. At the same binder content, the strength of the Al2O3 sand SLS specimen is much higher than that of commonly used quartz sand. Therefore, the binder-coated Al2O3 sands are very suitable for building large sand moulds with thin walls and delicate structures. On the other hand, to meet the same strength requirement for metal casting process, the Al2O3 sands need less binder content, consequently reducing gas evolution and thus improving the quality of final castings. Finally, a large sand mould for casting a complex six-cylinder diesel engine cylinder head was successfully manufactured by the SLS of the binder-coated Al2O3 sands, and the final casting with the surface quality and dimensional accuracy meeting the specific design requirements was obtained. The materials and method proposed in this paper not only shortened the trial production cycle of the six-cylinder engine from five months of the traditional casting method to 10 days, but also reduced the cost and improved the casting quality.",,,,,0.0,

The evaporation rate and mass transfer coefficient at the interface were determined by the proposed image process technique coupled with an infrared camera. Experimental results showed that once the infrared laser was applied, the interface temperature was rapidly increased but with non-uniform distribution as a result of such a tiny local heating source. Accompanying with the rapid temperature rise, the meniscus evaporation was also immediately actuated. After a certain laser heating period, the interface temperature was increased to a stable value with relatively uniform distribution. In the meantime, the evaporation rate increased and became steady. Besides, the effects of the laser power and laser spot position on the evaporation rate and mass transfer coefficient at the interface were also explored. It was shown that both the interface temperature and evaporation rate linearly increased with the laser power as a result of more heat generated. Smaller distance between the laser spot and front interface yielded higher interface temperature and evaporation rate because of smaller heat transfer resistance resulting from smaller transport length. Reducing the distance could make the increase of the evaporation rate to become more significant.

Good agreement between calculated and experimentally measured data on mass ablation rate per pulse and its dependence on incident laser fluence from 5 to 22 J/cm2, validated our theoretical model. Observed deviation between calculated and experimentally measured ablation rates at high average laser fluence levels was explained by ablation induced progressive degradation of target surface. Absence of abrupt increase in ablation rate with increased laser fluence suggested material ejection largely via normal boiling rather than explosive boiling mechanism. Calculated maximum surface temperature of the target was found to lie well below empirically estimated thermodynamic critical temperature for alumina, corroborating our observations on absence of onset of explosive boiling in alumina target on laser irradiation.

Surface analyses showed that this coating exhibits a high hydrophobicity due to its hierarchical structure and the use of hydrophobic polymer. An appropriate thermal treatment leads to the oxidation of the methyl groups and a formation of silicon oxide and silicon carbide that result in a wettability transition from hydrophobic to superhydrophilic. On this basis, we manufactured hydrophobic/superhydrophilic patterns on stainless-steel foils using a pulsed Nd:YAG laser. The uniform, superhydrophilic surface exhibited a 350% larger critical heat flux (CHF) than bare stainless-steel foil. High-speed IR thermography revealed that the increased wettability reduced the bubble contact diameter, allowed a higher density of active nucleation sites, and delayed the dry-out. The biphilic surfaces with differently sized hydrophobic spots exhibited the highest heat transfer coefficients, with an up to 200% higher CHF compared to the bare stainless steel. Smaller hydrophobic spots reduced the bubble diameter and increased the nucleation frequency. However, surfaces with larger hydrophobic regions promoted boiling incipience and exhibited higher heat transfer coefficients at low heat fluxes. These results suggest that the optimal biphilic pattern could only be determined for a particular operating point.

Here we tested whether planktonic and epilithic biofilm bacteria differ in their response to the quality of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Thus, planktonic and biofilm bacterial production was compared with patterns of DOC along a land-use gradient in the Bode catchment area (Germany). The freshness index of DOC was positively related to the proportion of agricultural area in the catchment. The humification index correlated with the proportion of forest area. Abundance and production of planktonic bacteria were lower in headwaters than at downstream sites. Planktonic production was weakly correlated to the total concentration of DOC but more strongly to quality-measures as revealed by spectra indexes, i.e. positively to the freshness index and negatively to the humification index. In contrast to planktonic bacteria, abundance and production of biofilm bacteria were independent of DOC quality. This finding may be explained by the association of biofilm bacteria with benthic algae and an extracellular matrix which represent additional substrate sources. The data show that planktonic bacteria seem to be regulated at a landscape scale controlled by land use, whereas biofilm bacteria are regulated at a biofilm matrix scale controlled by autochthonous production.

We demonstrated the antibacterial capability of this drug delivery system against Escherichia coli by the disk diffusion method, and antitumor efficacy toward the HeLa cell-derived tumor spheroids in vitro. This novel LGFU-responsive drug delivery system provides a simple and remote approach to precisely control the release of therapeutics in a spatiotemporal manner and potentially suppress detrimental effects to the surrounding tissue, such as thermal ablation.",,,,,0.0,

In recent years, great advances have been made in developing higher performance organic semiconductors. Many of these new materials show strongly process-dependent performance characteristics. The development of novel processing techniques is thus a key step towards utilizing the full potential of these semiconductor materials. Here we demonstrate a novel directional crystallization technique using a scanned thermal gradient to significantly improve the performance of printed OTFTs. A heat source is translated relative to the sample to induce the crystallization of the semiconductor. This scanned annealing creates a moving thermal gradient and thus develops a moving solvent evaporation gradient. Compared with uniform annealing on a hotplate grain size increases markedly and shows a clear directionality due to the separation of grain nucleation and growth. With this technique, mobility is boosted by about one order of magnitude. Mobilities close to 2 cm2/V s can be achieved. Off-state performance is likewise improved as evidenced by a 3× improvement in subthreshold swing.",,,,,0.0,

The 80PbF2–20B2O3-based HM had a broad PL band (480 nm), which was more intense than the narrow Eu3+ lines. To explain the obtained results, an exchange reaction that was accompanied by partial decomposition of the organic complex in the glass matrix was proposed.

They are likely formed under very specific conditions within a nitrogen-rich environment and may provide valuable clues on the origin of the population of interplanetary dusts accreted by Earth. In this study, we produced relevant analogs of such refractory organics characterized in three ultracarbonaceous Antarctic micrometeorites, starting from the carbonization of an HCN polymer and a tholin. Indeed, carbonization is a process that can increase the polyaromatic character toward a structure similar to that observed in these cosmomaterials. Both these precursors were degraded in an Ar atmosphere at 300, 500, 700 and 1000 °C over ∼1 h and characterized by elemental analysis, micro-FTIR and Raman micro-spectroscopy (at 244 and 514 nm excitation wavelengths). Our results show that the precursors evolve along distinct chemical and structural pathways during carbonization and that the influence of the precursor structure is still very strong at 1000 °C. Interestingly, these different carbonization routes appear in the spectral characteristics of the G and D bands of their Raman spectra. Several of the residues present chemical and structural similarities with three recently studied ultracarbonaceous micrometeorites (Dobrica et al. [2011]. Meteorit. Planet.

However, the residues do not simultaneously account for the carbon structure (Raman) and the chemical composition (IR, N/C ratio). This indicates that the precursors and/or heating conditions in our experiments are not fully relevant.

Here we analyzed spectra of fluorescent dissolved organic matter (fDOM) in coral reefs in the context of a suite of biogeochemical parameters along gradients of SGD to characterize fDOM composition and evaluate the utility of fDOM signatures in tracking groundwater dispersal and transformation.

Under high ionic strength conditions, aggregation is mainly governed by diffusion and the aggregates formed under these conditions showed the lowest stability and fractal dimension, forming linear, chain-like aggregates. In contrast, under low ionic strength conditions, the aggregate structure was more compact, most likely due to strong chemical binding with DOM and bridging mechanisms involving divalent cations formed during reaction-limited aggregation.",,,,,0.0,

When the ZrAcac was processed in both air and under N2, low work function (3.9 and 3.7 eV respectively), highly transparent layers were formed, with good energetic alignment to both C60 and hexachlorinated boron subphthalocyanine chloride (Cl6-SubPc) acceptors.

We established 275 plots in regular 200 × 200 m grid in a forested area of 14.4 km2. Fieldwork included soil sampling of the organic horizon, mineral topsoil and subsoil down to 40 cm deep. We analysed the vertical and horizontal distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, as well as the quantity of physically separated fractions including the free light (fLF), occluded light (oLF) and mineral associated fractions (MAF) in the mineral topsoil (A, AE) horizons. Distribution of C in soils was predominantly affected by the variation in the FF content. In soils richer in the FF more SOC was accumulated in mineral horizons and less in the organic horizons. Accumulation of SOC in mineral soil was also positively affected by the degree of saturation of SOM with Al and Fe. The increasing share of beech influenced the distribution of C stock in soil profiles by reducing the depth of O horizon and increasing C stored in mineral soil. The content of FF was positively correlated with the content of C in MAF and fLF fractions. The content of oLF and MAF fractions was also positively influenced by a higher degree of metal saturation, particularly Al. Our results confirmed that Al plays an important role in the stabilization of SOM inside aggregates (CoLF) and as in CMAF fractions.

Removal of the proteins resulted in approximately 40% decrease in the fracture toughness with respect to the fully proteinized control. The loss of organic content was most detrimental to the extrinsic toughening mechanisms, causing over 80% reduction in their contribution to the total energy to fracture. This degradation occurred by embrittlement of the unbroken bridging ligaments and consequent reduction in the crack closure stress.

In this study, samples of fine particulate matter emissions with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) were collected for 12-hour periods during the spring and fall of 2011 and 2012. Eighty-three samples were analyzed for organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC). The carbonaceous fraction (OC + EC) accounted for 28–55% of the PM2.5 mass. The average OC/EC ratios ranged from 7.4 to 12.6, and OC and EC concentrations were statistically significant correlated (R2 = 0.81, p < 0.01). The secondary organic aerosol (SOA) contributions were determined using two approaches: the EC tracer method based on a primary OC/EC ratio derived from a tunnel study and the minimum observed OC/EC ratio. SOAs were determined to constitute, on average, 59–87% and 32–45% of the total OC and PM2.5, respectively. The relationship between O3 and wind speed indicated that pollutant levels were influenced by transport events during the spring, while stagnation events predominated during the fall campaigns.

It is recognized that both air-drying and rewetting of soil samples affect the characteristics of organic matter (OM), but systematic evaluations are scarce. In this review, we synthesize what is known in the scientific literature concerning the types and magnitudes of effects resulting from air-drying and rewetting with respect to i) characteristics of aggregate-associated and water-extractable OM, ii) soil microbiota, and iii) decomposition of OM. Air-drying of soil samples results in the formation of new and/or stronger OM-mineral interactions as well as increased hydrophobicity and mineral surface acidity. The formation of new and enhancement of existing OM-mineral interactions may lead to an increase in perceived aggregate stability, potentially affecting estimates of amount and persistence of OM associated with soil aggregates. Compared to field moist samples, air-dried samples had 8–41% higher relative dry mass proportions in the 2–0.25 mm aggregate size fraction. Pronounced changes in the amount and composition of the water-extractable OM and soil microbiota are also detected during the course of air-drying and rewetting with the potential to affect the conclusions derived from OM decomposition experiments. Air-dried soil samples were found to have 2–10 times higher amounts of water extractable organic carbon and a decrease between 3% and 69% in the microbial biomass carbon (using the substrate-induced respiration technique) compared to field moist samples.

Another potential technique will be plasma FIB, it used very high milling current and fast milling speed (Hrnčíř et al., 2013). However, it comes with a very high cost and having the contamination issue. The contamination issue greatly affects the low kV Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) imaging quality. In recent semiconductor industry FA, low kV SEM imaging is preferable, because high kV imaging will introduce delamination artifacts especially on organic material from packaged sample. In this paper, Fast Laser Deprocessing Techniques (FLDT) application is further enhanced on large area cross-sectional FA with fast cycle time and low-cost equipment. This is to prevent from mechanical damage. In short, the proposed FLDT is a cost-effective and quick way to deprocess a sample for defect identification in cross-sectional FA.",,,,,0.0,

In SLLO, laser is irradiated to selectively separate micro-LED devices from a transparent sapphire substrate. The light source used is an ultraviolet (UV) laser with a wavelength of 266 nm, pulse duration of 20 ns, and repetition rate of 30 kHz. Controlled adhesion between a LED and the substrate is key for a SLLO process with high yield and reliability. This study examined the fundamental relationship between adhesion and laser irradiation. Two competing mechanisms affect adhesion at the irradiated interface between the GaN LED and sapphire substrate: Ga precipitation caused by the thermal decomposition of GaN and roughened interface caused by thermal damage on the sapphire. The competition between these two mechanisms leads to a non-trivial SLLO condition that needs optimization. This study helps understand the SLLO process, and accelerate the development of a process for manufacturing micro-LED displays via SLLO for future applications.",,,,,0.0,

Linear features of circa 25 μm width and 12 μm height are achieved on amorphous and crystalline titania and graphitic carbon films deposited on silicon. Ablated protrusions build up barriers decorated by nanoscale Si-film reconstructions, as indicated by EDX maps and micro-Raman spectroscopy. Wettability tests show a dramatic change in water contact angle, which leads to almost full wetting after irradiation, irrespective of the original film composition. Fluorescence microscopy images of human mesenchymal stem cells cultured on 1D and 2D structures demonstrate the short term biocompatibility of the ablated surfaces. It is shown that cells adhere, extend and polarize on feature edges, independently of the type of surface, thus suggesting that the created nanoroughness is at the origin of the antifouling behavior.

Standard sample preparation typically comprises the disaggregation of aggregated and agglomerated particles into single primary particles, i.e., the organic binding material is oxidized by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and the contained carbonates are dissolved by hydrochloric acid (HCl). The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of HCl treatment on grain size analyses of Late Pleistocene and Holocene loess–paleosol-sequences investigated by a Beckman Coulter LS 13320 laser particle analyzer. For this purpose, samples from two different sections with different weathering degrees and sedimentary genesis were measured: (1) the Suohuoduo section on the northeastern fringe of the Tibetan Plateau (China) containing loess and paleosols, and (2) a vibracore from Düsseldorf-Grafenberg (Germany) containing calcareous loess and intercalated interglacial, interstadial and periglacial soils and soil sediments. All samples were pretreated with hydrogen peroxide and sodium pyrophosphate. Subsequently, the samples were prepared with and without the addition of HCl. There is no significant association of the HCl-induced grain size modifications after the HCl treatment with the calcium carbonate content. Conversely, a distinct dependence of the modification of grain size distributions on the content of organic matter, the weathering degree of the sediment, and the presence of stable aggregates as well as organo-mineral complexes was observed. Consequently, pretreating post-depositionally modified aeolian sediments with HCl may result in misleading grain size distributions and should be avoided in standard analyses of loess–paleosol-sequences. However, the HCl-induced modification of grain size distributions provides an indication of the existence of stable aggregates or organo-mineral complexes.",,,,,0.0,

Our results show that the spatial distribution and the evolution of the molecular species in the ablation plume, such as C2 and CN, exhibit clear different behaviors for polymers without any native CC bond, with CC single bonds or with CC double bonds respectively.

Phase explosion phenomena occurring at high laser fluences produce nanoparticles (NPs) with an average size of ∼5 nm having narrow size distribution (3–10 nm) and low degree of agglomeration, which are randomly arranged in the form of coating on the substrate surface. In comparison with chemically synthesized Co3O4 crystalline powder, the NPACs deposited by PLD showed significantly higher catalytic activity for H2 generation by hydrolysis of NaBH4. Maximum H2 generation rate obtained by NPACs (5010 ml min−1 gcat−1) is about 5 times higher than that produced by Co3O4 powder (1000 ml min−1 gcat−1), which is mainly attributed to high surface area and large number of active sites provided by the Co3O4 NPs in the coating owing to their size and shape. By varying the O2 pressure during PLD, two different cobalt oxide phases, namely Co3O4 and CoO, were formed in NPACs and found that Co3O4 phase is more active for hydrolysis than CoO phase with lower oxidation number. The morphology and crystallinity of Co3O4 NPACs were tuned by varying the laser fluence and substrate temperature respectively, and their effect on H2 generation rate was studied. The results showed that the NPs with mixed amorphous-nanocrystalline phase on the surface act as active sites for favorable interaction and NaBH4 conversion.",,,,,0.0,

The component material of the wooden sculpture was identified by observing the thin sections under an optical microscope; the materials layered on the surface were analyzed by optical microscopy, micro-Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The laser cleaning tests were carried out with a Q-switched Nd:YAG system. The surface was examined before and after the cleaning with the aid of a video-microscope, reflectance spectrophotometer and scanning electron microscopy. The steps of the work were documented on a digital tri-dimensional model of the sculpture created by a close range image system in order to carefully register scientific, technical, conservative, and material aspects. The microscopic observation of wood thin sections allows identifying it as lime tree. The analysis of the surface materials highlighted the presence of lead white applied by a siccative oil and barium sulphate. The infrared spectroscopic analysis of the brown surface layer revealed the presence of shellac. The laser cleaning proved an effective method to remove the surface dirt and to reduce the aged protective layer without affecting negatively the wood. The diagnostic analysis carried out prior and during the cleaning process was fundamental to verify the applicability of the laser to the wood surface in order to obtain an efficient cleaning action without secondary damaging effects. In addition, considering the reduced number of laser cleaning examples applied to wooden material available in literature, the documentation of the adopted working process could be a useful reference for the divulgation and sharing of the obtained data.",,,,,0.0,

Improving our understanding of these feedbacks and of their effects on tidal geomorphological and ecological dynamics is a critical step to address issues related to salt-marsh conservation and response to changes in the environmental forcing. In particular, the spatial variation of organic and inorganic soil production processes at the marsh scale, a key piece of information to understand marsh responses to a changing climate, remains virtually unexplored. In order to characterize the relative importance of organic vs. inorganic deposition as a function of space, we collected 33 shallow soil sediment samples along three transects in the San Felice and Rigà salt marshes located in the Venice lagoon, Italy. The amount of organic matter in each sample was evaluated using Loss On Ignition (LOI), a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) treatment, and a sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) treatment following the H2O2 treatment. The grain size distribution of the inorganic fraction was determined using laser diffraction techniques. Our study marshes exhibit a weakly concave-up profile, with maximum elevations and coarser inorganic grains along their edges. The amount of organic and inorganic matter content in the samples varies with the distance from the marsh edge and is very sensitive to the specific analysis method adopted. The use of a H2O2+NaClO treatment yields an organic matter density value which is more than double the value obtained from LOI. Overall, inorganic contributions to soil formation are greatest near the marsh edges, whereas organic soil production is the main contributor to soil accretion in the inner marsh. We interpret this pattern by considering that while plant biomass productivity is generally lower in the inner part of the marsh, organic soil decomposition rates are highest in the better aerated edge soils. Hence the higher inorganic soil content near the edge is due to the preferential deposition of inorganic sediment from the adjacent creek, and to the rapid decomposition of the relatively large biomass production. The higher organic matter content in the inner part of the marsh results from the small amounts of suspended sediment that makes it to the inner marsh, and to the low decomposition rate which more than compensates for the lower biomass productivity in the low-lying inner zones. Finally, the average soil organic carbon density from the LOI measurements is estimated to be 0.044 g C cm−3. The corresponding average carbon accumulation rate for the San Felice and Rigà salt marshes, 132 g C m−2 yr−1, highlights the considerable carbon stock and sequestration rate associated with coastal salt marshes.",,,,,0.0,

The combination of a Q-switched Nd:YAG pulsed laser with the diagnostics typical of the LIBS technique was shown to be very effective for monitoring, controlling and characterizing the laser cleaning process of limestone. The different elemental compositions of the black encrustations covering the stone surface and the underlying stone allowed to evaluate and avoid over-cleaning and/or under-cleaning. Further, coupling LIBS to the cleaning process provided important information about the optimal experimental conditions to be used for evaluating the conservation status and determining the most proper cleaning restoration procedure before operating the consolidation of the blocks. Thus a sufficient removal of unwanted layers could be achieved without modifying the surface underneath and ameliorating the effectiveness of traditional cleaning techniques.

This paper discusses the boundary lubrication effects of invisible residues from organic solvents that have been widely used in tribological studies in ambient conditions. Stainless steel, soda lime glass, and copper substrates were cleaned using UV/ozone treatment or organic solvents such as alcohols where the solvent was allowed to evaporate from the surface. In ball-on-flat tribo-tests, all UV/ozone cleaned samples showed high friction and catastrophic wear immediately upon sliding due to the absence of lubricants at the sliding interface, while samples cleaned by organic solvent experienced low friction and minimal wear for hundreds of reciprocating cycles. Analyses of the surface by atomic force microscopy and vibrational spectroscopy indicated that the solvent cleaning deposits hydrocarbon residue on metal and oxide substrates. This residue is due to trace impurities with low vapor pressures inevitably present in the bulk liquid, regardless of solvent purity, which become concentrated upon vaporization of the high vapor pressure solvent. These results demonstrated that drying after cleaning with organic solvents is equivalent to a dip-coating of low vapor pressure organics onto the sample surface. This dip-coating effect can be avoided if surfaces are cleaned using UV/ozone or if the surface is immediately rinsed with DI water and blow-dried after cleaning with organic solvent.

For one-dimensional rubrene NRs, the PL waveguiding characteristics are improved when using an indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrate and an oil objective lens, compared to a SiO2 substrate and an air gap lens. We also observe abnormal behavior in PL waveguiding, such as an abrupt enhancement of the waveguiding efficiency at the point of electron-beam treatment in the rubrene NRs. These results can be analyzed in terms of geometrically constructive interference of optical path in the CN-TSDB MPs, and of the local variation in the molecular ordering of the rubrene NRs resulting from the focused electron-beam irradiation.",,,,,2.0,

Al doped ZnO thin films were deposited on a glass substrate by spray pyrolysis deposition technique. The thin films were irradiated using the 8 MeV electron beam from microtron ranging from 1  kG y to 5  kG y. Nonlinear optical studies were carried out by employing the single beam Z-scan technique to determine the sign and magnitude of absorptive and refractive nonlinearities of the irradiated thin films. Continuous wave He–Ne laser operating at 633 nm was used as source of excitation. The open aperture Z-scan measurements indicated the sample displays reverse saturable absorption (RSA) process. The negative sign of the nonlinear refractive index n2 was noted from the closed aperture Z-scan measurements indicates, the films exhibit self-defocusing property due to thermal nonlinearity. The third-order nonlinear optical susceptibility χ(3) varies from 8.17 × 10−5 esu to 1.39 × 10−3 esu with increase in electron beam irradiation. The present study reveals that the irradiation of electron beam leads to significant changes in the third-order optical nonlinearity. Al doped ZnO displays good optical power handling capability with optical clamping of about ∼5 mW. The irradiation study endorses that the Al doped ZnO under investigation is a promising candidate photonic device applications such as all-optical power limiting.",,,,,1.0,

The evidence of this can be seen in the ubiquitous red colouration of the Martian sediment. This radiation will destroy most signals of life in the top few metres of the Martian surface. If organic carbon (one of the building blocks of life) is present within the accessible Martian sediments, it is very likely that it will have experienced some oxidation. ESA׳s ExoMars mission set to fly in 2018, has on board a miniaturised Raman spectrometer. As Raman spectroscopy is sensitive to carbonaceous material and will be primarily used to characterise organics, it is essential that the effect oxidation has on the Raman carbon signal is assessed. Oxidised carbonaceous shales were analysed using Raman spectroscopy to assess this issue. Results show that haematite has a band which occurs in the same frequency as the carbon D band, which cannot be distinguished from each other. This can lead to a misidentification of the carbon D band and a misinterpretation of the carbon order. Consequently, caution must be taken when applying Raman spectroscopy for organic carbon analysis in oxidised terrestrial and extraterrestrial environments, including on Mars.",,,,,0.0,

Since OSCs are lacking intrinsic carriers, charges for device operation have to be injected through organic/electrode and organic/organic interfaces. Therefore, the charge injection efficiency, which is determined by the energy level alignments at those interfaces, governs the device performance. In other words, high performance organic devices cannot be achieved without facilitating proper energy level alignments. Thus, the interfacial electronic structure, which should be determined from accurate measurements of the charge transport level, must be understood to establish the design strategy for high performance organic devices. In this review, various spectroscopic methods to investigate the surface and interface electronic structures, including direct photoelectron spectroscopy, inverse photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray emission spectroscopy, are discussed along with their fundamental principles.

On the other hand the resist was specially designed for the use in combination with Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamps, its negligible propensity to permeate into the stamp material under contact leads to an improved stamp life time compared to the use of common imprint resists.

The deposition process was carried out at various temperatures of the substrates from room temperature to 825 K in order to investigate these properties of the films and their mutual influence. The structural and morphological properties of the films were investigated by X-Ray Diffraction and Atomic Force Microscopy measurements, respectively. The quality of the films was improved with an increase of the substrate temperature. The linear optical properties of the films were studied by classic and time-resolved photoluminescence spectra in the broad range of the temperature from 13 K to 325 K. Classic photoluminescence measurement allowed us to estimate band gap energy as a function of the temperature. An innovative time-resolved photoluminescence technique lets us precisely measure the decay time in the real time. Results of these measurements reveal a simple exponential decay behavior typical for well oriented crystalline thin films. Presented spectra confirm high structural and linear optical quality of investigated films. The nonlinear optical properties of the films were investigated by Third Harmonic Generation technique.

For blanket layers, an aqueous polymer-based hole injection layer (HIL) and non-aqueous polymer-based hole transport layer (HTL) are fabricated by slot-die coating and also by spin coating for comparison. Thin organic films coated on a substrate with a pixel-defining layer (bank) exhibit the concave profile due to capillary rise. With an attempt to suppress it and thus obtain thin films with high conformity, we carry out solution coating by varying the pixel size, solvent, and drying condition. As the pixel size increases, the overall film thickness increases by an enhancement in the filling of a solution into the cells. We have found that spin coating provides more conformal thin films for the aqueous polymer HIL. When a high-boiling-point solvent and vacuum drying are used for the non-aqueous polymer HTL, however, the film conformity by slot-die coating is higher than that by spin coating. It is attributed that an evaporation-induced convective flow (microflow) occurs from the pixel edge to the center.

We collected diverse biophysical data to allow spatial variability of soil organic carbon and factors contributing to this variation to be determined statistically, and used well established simulation models to interpret the data, predict long-term carbon dynamics and determine the potential for improvements in soil quality and mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. The spatial variation in soil organic carbon in the 0–20 cm soil depth was significant across study areas (P < 0.01, 21.6 g kg−1–37.8 g kg−1), and between land-uses (P < 0.05, 27.9 g kg−1 in cropland and 43.0 g kg−1 soil in forestland). In a multiple linear regression model, among the 11 explanatory variables used, four (total nitrogen, shrubs, trees and land use) showed a significant positive effect (P < 0.01), while three (impact of grazing, impact of erosion and clay) showed a significant negative effect (P < 0.01). Simulations using the assumption of steady state to estimate carbon dynamics suggested that plant inputs from croplands are generally lower than grass or shrublands, resulting in build-up of recalcitrant organic matter in shrublands compared to grass or croplands. Erosion results in a decline in both the absolute and relative amounts of carbon in recalcitrant pools, but the more active pools remained unchanged, meaning that the overall activity of soil organic matter is increased when the soil is eroded, and it becomes more difficult to sequester soil carbon. More rapid decrease in soil organic carbon is likely to be due to increased erosion, persistent removal of organic materials, grazing pressures, and higher rate of decompositions in cropland and grazing land-uses. Conversion to shrubland shows high potential to quickly restore eroded soils and build up a pool of recalcitrant soil carbon, suggesting that management of land using periodic 20 year exclosures, preventing cropping and grazing and allowing shrubland succession, could be beneficial in restoring degraded soils. Simulations using a calibration approach, rather than assuming steady state, corroborated these findings, suggesting that after 30 years of current management, croplands will deplete soil organic carbon by 5.6, 7.1 and 7.2 t ha−1, and grasslands by 3.5, 3.9 and 2.7 t ha−1, while shrublands will build-up soil organic carbon by 0.6, 0.1 and 1.3 t ha−1 at study sites.

To date, SPAMS is most often used to provide unscaled information for both the size and chemical composition of individual particles. The instrument's lack of accuracy is primarily due to only a fraction of particles being detected after collection, and the instrumental sensitivity is un-calibrated for various chemical species in mixed ambient aerosols. During a campaign from January to April 2013 at a coastal site in Hong Kong, the particle number information and ion intensity of major PM2.5 components collected by SPAMS were scaled by comparing with collocated bulk PM2.5 measurements of hourly or higher resolution. The bulk measurements include PM2.5 mass by a SHARP 5030 Monitor, major ions by a Monitor for Aerosols & Gases in ambient Air (MARGA), and organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) by a Sunset OCEC analyzer. During the data processing, both transmission efficiency (scaled with the Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer) and hit efficiency conversion were considered, and component ion intensities quantified as peak area (PA) and relative peak area (RPA) were analyzed to track the performance. The comparison between the scaled particle mass assuming a particle density of 1.9 g cm−3 from SPAMS and PM2.5 concentration showed good correlation (R2 = 0.81) with a slope of 0.814 ± 0.004. Regression analysis results suggest an improved scaling performance using RPA compared with PA for most of the major PM2.5 components, including sulfate, nitrate, potassium, ammonium, OC and EC. Thus, we recommend preferentially scaling these species using the RPA. For periods of high K+ concentrations (>1.5 μg m−3), under-estimation of K+ by SPAMS was observed due to exceeding the dynamic range of the acquisition board. When only applying the hit efficiency correction, data for sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, potassium and OC were in reasonably good correlation (R2 = 0.56–0.79) with the bulk measurements, suggesting semi-quantified data by the hit efficiency correction can be utilized when transmission efficiency correction is not available.

The robustness and stability of AFM1-ovalbumin conjugate allow the regeneration of modified biosensor surface for more than 200 times, thereby achieving a cost-effective and reliable AFM1 determination. The proposed method provides a rapid, ultrasensitive, and reliable AFM1 determination in dairy products without complicated sample pretreatment process.",,,,,0.0,

In order to evaluate if a source rock is suitable for economical exploitation, the evaluation of many factors is required, among which the most important are concentration of the organic matter and its quality (e.g. kerogen type and thermal maturity) that evolves following temperature and pressure over burial history. The most commonly used techniques to characterize the thermal maturity of organic matter are the maximum pyrolysis temperature of generated hydrocarbons and the reflectance of vitrinite macerals (%Ro). The limitations to the applicability of these analyses is the driving force to develop new methods and in particular spectroscopic ones. In this work the maturity of different kerogens (i.e. solid organic matter entrapped into rocks), both naturally and artificially aged, is determined by Raman and Attenuated Total Reflection-InfraRed (ATR-IR) spectroscopies, applied directly to source rocks. The parameterization of spectra by suitable variables proved to allow evaluating kerogen maturity with the best reliability at lower rank for ATR-IR and at higher rank for Raman analysis. Good correlations were obtained between Raman and ATR-IR spectroscopic parameters and the above mentioned vitrinite reflectance (%Ro).",,,,,0.0,

Soil samples were collected at two highway tree planting sites in Ontario, Canada. The average soil bulk density in the 0–10 and 20–30 cm range was 1.45 g cm−3 and 1.55 g cm−3, respectively, at Site 1. At site 2, the average soil bulk density in the 0–10 and 20–30 cm range was 1.49 g cm−3 and 1.67 g cm−3, respectively. Six treatments were established on each site to determine the amount of organic amendment required to decrease bulk density and increase tree growth as a measurement of successful tree establishment. Compost was incorporated into the soil at 0%, 10%, 25% and 50% on a volume-to-volume basis at both sites. In 2014 Acer x freemanii Autumn Blaze® ‘Jeffersred’ whips were planted into each treatment bed (Site 1, n = 36 and Site 2 n = 42). Bulk density, porosity, soil pH, EC, tree survival, height, shoot extension and chlorophyll content were measured for the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons. Incorporation of 25% v/v compost consistently decreased bulk density to below-root restricting thresholds, resulting in improved tree growth. Significant differences were observed in chlorophyll content between organic-amended remediated treatment beds compared to the control; chlorophyll content was significantly higher (p < 0.05) for the 25% and 50% treatments throughout the 2015 growing season at both sites. Incorporation of compost at 10% and 25% v/v effectively reduced soil bulk density, leading to increased growth and reduced tree stress at both sites.

Several biochars, with different feedstock origins, were evaluated for their effectiveness at improving soil quality of a sandy agricultural soil. A pot trial was used to investigate aggregate stability and microbial activity, pore water trace element mobility and micronutrient concentrations in grain of spring wheat after incorporation of three biochars. The feedstocks for biochar production were selected because they were established UK waste products, namely oversize woody material from green waste composting facilities, and rhododendron and soft wood material from forest clearance operations. Biochars were incorporated into the soil at a rate of 5% v/v. Aggregate stability was improved following addition of oversize biochar whilst microbial activity increased in all treatments. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in soil pore water from biochar-treated soils were raised, whilst micronutrient concentrations in wheat grain grown in the treated soils were significantly reduced.

These environments are also commonly underlain by sulfidic sediments which can oxidise to form coastal acid sulfate soils (CASS) and contain high concentrations of acidity and trace metals. CASS are found on every continent globally except Antarctica. When sulfidic sediments are oxidised, scalds can form, which are large bare patches without vegetation. However, SOC stocks and fractions have not been quantified in these coastal floodplain environments. We studied the changes in soil geochemistry and SOC stocks and fractions three years after remediation of a CASS scald. Remediation treatments included raising water levels, and addition of either lime (LO) or lime and mulch (LM) relative to a control (C) site. We found SOC concentrations in the remediated sites (LO and LM) were more than double than that found at site C, reflected in the higher SOC stocks to a depth of 1.6 m (426 Mg C/ha, 478 Mg C/ha and 473 Mg C/ha at sites C, LO and LM, respectively). The particulate organic C (POC) fraction was higher at sites LO and LM due to increased vegetation and biomass inputs, compared to site C. Reformation of acid volatile sulfide (AVS) occurred throughout the profile at site LM, whereas only limited AVS reformation occurred at sites LO and C. Higher AVS at site LM may be linked to the additional source of organic matter provided by the mulch.

Therefore, coastal floodplains and wetlands are a large store of SOC and can potentially increase SOC following remediation due to i) reduced decomposition rates with higher water levels and waterlogging, and ii) high C inputs due to rapid revegetation of scalded areas and high rates of biomass production.

This study aims to investigate the impacts of water transportation time after algal suspension prechlorination on cell integrity, AOM release, and DBP formation during the dissolved phase chlorination. The damage to cell integrity after prechlorination was indicated to depend not only on chlorine dose but also on transportation time. The highest dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) values were observed at 2 mg/L chlorine preoxidation before transportation, but were obtained at 0.4 mg/L chlorine after 480-min simulated transportation. The variation of DON with transportation time was indicated to be mainly influenced by the small molecular weight nitrogenous organic compounds, such as amino acids. Additionally, formation of the corresponding chlorinated carbonaceous disinfection byproducts (C-DBPs) and nitrogenous disinfection byproducts (N-DBPs) during the dissolved phase chlorination showed the same variation tendency as DOC and DON respectively. The highest C-DBP (98.4 μg/L) and N-DBP (5.5 μg/L) values were obtained at 0.4 mg/L chlorine preoxidation after 480-min simulated transportation.

The efficiency of these devices is negatively affected by carbon (C) incorporation, which comes either from the direct C–N bond in the N precursor unsymmetrical 1,1-dimethylhydrazine (UDMHy) used conventionally or from the alkyl groups of the conventional precursors for gallium (Ga), indium and arsenic (As) containing carbon. This C is incorporated together with the N due to the strength of the C–N bond. A further important issue in dilute nitride growth is the very low N incorporation efficiency in the crystal from UDMHy, which can be as little as 1% of the N supplied in the gas phase. Therefore, new metal organic chemicals have to be synthesized and their growth characteristics and suitability for dilute nitride growth have to be explored. This work presents the chemical di-tertiary-butyl-arsano-amine (DTBAA), which was synthesized, purified and tested as an N precursor for metal organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE). Computational investigations show β-hydrogen and isobutane elimination to be the main reaction channel in the gas phase with high reaction barriers and absence of small fragments containing C as products. The loss of N via N2, as in UDMHy, can be excluded for unimolecular reactions of DTBAA. The Ga(NAs)/GaAs heterostructures were grown by MOVPE as initial test material and a systematic N incorporation study is presented in this paper. It is shown that high quality Ga(NAs) can be grown using DTBAA. The N incorporation was confirmed by high resolution X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence studies. All samples grown exhibit as grown room temperature photoluminescence and smooth surface morphologies. Furthermore, DTBAA shows extremely high N incorporation efficiency, which makes this molecule a very promising candidate for further research into dilute nitride material growth.",,,,,0.0,

Three separate pilot systems were used consisting of: (1) two columns, (2) ten columns and (3) twenty two columns to create oxic, suboxic (partial nitrate removal) and anoxic (complete nitrate removal). The pilot set-up has some unique features - it can simulate fairly long residence times (e.g., 45 days using the 22 column system) and reduced conditions developed naturally within the system. Dimethoate, diuron, and metoprolol showed redox dependent removal behaviour with higher biodegradation rates in the oxic zone compared to the suboxic/anoxic zone. The redox dependent behaviour of these three OMPs could not be explained based on their physico-chemical properties (hydrophobicity, charge and molecular weight) or functional groups present in the molecular structure. OMPs that showed persistent behaviour in the oxic zone (atrazine, carbamazepine, hydrochlorothiazide and simazine) were also not removed under more reduced conditions. Adaptive behaviour was observed for five OMPs: dimethoate, chloridazon, lincomycin, sulfamethoxazole and phenazone. However, the adaptive behaviour could not be explained by the physico-chemical properties (hydrophobicity, charge and molecular weight) investigated in this study and only rough trends were observed with specific functional groups (e.g. ethers, sulphur, primary and secondary amines). Finally, the adaptive behaviour of OMPs was found to be an important factor that should be incorporated in predictive models for OMP removal during river bank filtration.",,,,,0.0,

The use of the low band gap Si-PCPDTBT vastly improves the spectral response, when compared to a P3HT:PC71BM binary system. The optimum blend composition occurred at a total polymer concentration of 50 wt%. At low polymer concentrations, the P3HT phase was amorphous in nature. Increasing the polymer content led to the formation of crystalline polymer domains, as evidenced by XRD measurements. This significantly enhanced the charge carrier transport throughout the active layer. XPS depth profiles indicated that variations in the polymer content also influenced the mixing between the Si-PCPDTBT and the P3HT host matrix. This analysis showed that the 50 wt% was conducive to a larger interaction between the two polymers. A comprehensive analysis of the relative contributions of each molecule to the photoluminescence suggested that the polymer concentration not only affects the film microstructure, it also influences the photoluminescence quantum yield of the blend. This is caused by alterations to the recombination mechanisms occurring in the constituent materials, which, in turn, influences photocurrent generation. This result shows that the overall polymer content must be chosen carefully to strike a delicate balance between improved absorption and effective charge generation and collection.",,,,,2.0,

The average absolute deviations were 158 and 392 (in units of 10−30 esu) for β(0) and β(0.67 eV), respectively, in the gas phase. These errors correspond, on average, to 49% and 65% of the experimental values. The inclusion of solvent effects (CHCl3) through a continuum model slightly improves the predictions of β(0.67 eV), with absolute error decreasing to 265 (in units of 10−30 esu), corresponding to an error of 35%. For the julolidinyl-(CHCH)2–C(CH3) = CH–CHCH–CHC(CH3)–CHCH–CHN,N'-diethylthiobarbituric acid (molecule st_5_6, Graphical Abstract), which presents the highest NLO response among the compounds analyzed, the calculated value for μβ(0.67 eV) in CHCl3 was 40,255 × 10−48 esu, in satisfactory accordance with the experimental data, 34,779 × 10−48 esu (an error of 16% only). In addition, the two-states approach was applied for the set of molecules studied, and the results showed that the increase in total β is explained well by the charge transfer excitation, involving the frontier orbitals.

Herein, we present the preparation of solid lipid nanoparticles loaded with a hydrophilic compound by a novel organic solvent free double emulsion/melt dispersion technique. The main objective of this study was to investigate the influence of important process and formulation variables, such as lipid composition, surfactant type, sonication parameters and lipid solidification conditions over physicochemical characteristics of SLN dispersion.

In that regard, a stretchable TEG can be interesting to adaptively control the temperature difference. Here we show, the development of simple yet versatile and highly stretchable thermoelectric generators (TEGs), by combining well-known inorganic thermoelectric materials Bismuth Telluride and Antimony Telluride (Bi2Te3 and Sb2Te3) with organic substrates (Off-Stoichiometry Thiol-Enes polymer platform – OSTE, polyimide or paper) and novel helical architecture (double-arm spiral/helix) to achieve over 100% stretchability. First, an OSTE-based TEG design demonstrates higher open circuit voltage generation at 100% strain than at rest, although it exhibits high internal resistance and a relatively complex fabrication process. The second, simpler TEG design, achieves a significant resistance reduction and two different structural substrates (PI and paper) are compared. The paper-based TEG generates 17 nW (ΔT=75 °C) at 60% strain, which represents more than twice the power generation while at rest (zero strain). On the other hand, polyimide produces more conductive TE films and higher power (~35 nW at ΔT=75 °C) but due to its higher thermal conductivity, power does not increase at stretch. In conclusion, highly stretchable TEGs can lead to higher temperature gradients (thus higher power generation), given that thermal conductivity of the structural material is low enough. Furthermore, either horizontal or vertical displacement can be achieved with double-arm helical architecture, hence allowing to extend the device to any nearby and mobile heat sink for continuous, effectively higher power generation.",,,,,0.0,

Over the past two decades, mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) has been established as a powerful technique for the analysis of molecular distribution of a variety of compounds across tissue surfaces. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) MSI is widely used to study the spatial distribution of common lipids. However, a thorough sample preparation and necessity of vacuum for efficient ionization might hamper its use for high-throughput lipid analysis. Desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) is a relatively young MS technique. In DESI, ionization of molecules occurs under ambient conditions, which alleviates sample preparation. Moreover, DESI does not require the application of an external matrix, making the detection of low mass species more feasible due to the lack of chemical matrix background. However, irrespective of the ionization method, the final information obtained during an MSI experiment is very complex and its analysis becomes challenging. It was shown that coupling MSI to ion mobility separation (IMS) simplifies imaging data interpretation. Here we employed DESI and MALDI MSI for a lipidomic analysis of the murine brain using the same IMS-enabled instrument. We report for the first time on the DESI IMS-MSI of multiply sialylated ganglioside species, as well as their acetylated versions, which we detected directly from the murine brain tissue. We show that poly-sialylated gangliosides can be imaged as multiply charged ions using DESI, while they are clearly separated from the rest of the lipid classes based on their charge state using ion mobility. This represents a major improvement in MSI of intact fragile lipid species.

The resulting localised hotspots of nutrient application will induce various biotic and abiotic nutrient turnover processes and fixation in the residuesphere, giving rise to distinct differences in nutrient availability, soil oxygen content and greenhouse gas (GHG) production. In this study we investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics of the reaction of manure solids and manure solids char with soil, focusing on their phosphorus (P) availability, as current emphasis on improving societal P efficiency through recycling waste or bio-based fertilisers necessitates a sound understanding of their behaviour. Soil layers amended at a constant P application rate with either pig manure solids or char made from pig manure solids were incubated for three weeks between layers of non-amended, P-depleted soil. Spatial and temporal changes in and around the amendment layers were simultaneously investigated in this study using a sandwich sensor consisting of a planar oxygen optode and multi-element diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) gels, combined with GHG emission measurements. After three weeks of incubation, the soil containing a layer amended with manure solids had a lower overall O2 content and had emitted significantly more CO2 than the non-amended control or the char-amended soil. The P availability from manure solids was initially higher than that from the char, but decreased over time, whereas from the char-amended layer P availability increased in the same period. In both treatments, increases in P availability were confined to the amended soil layer and did not greatly affect P availability in the directly adjacent soil layers during the three-week incubation. These results highlight the importance of placing organic P fertilisers close to where the plant roots will grow in order to facilitate optimal fertiliser use efficiency.",,,,,0.0,

The generation of protein-like compounds was paired to increases in the prokaryote abundance, being higher in the nutrient-amended tanks than in the control. Different patterns in the magnitude and direction of the generation of humic-like molecules suggested that these changes depended on initial microbial populations and the availability of extra nutrient inputs.

For this purpose several ecotoxicological assays were performed with different test species (terrestrial plants: Zea mays, Avena sativa, Brassica oleracea and Lycopersicon esculentum; soil invertebrates: Eisenia andrei and Folsomia candida). A wide range of SDS/DDAB concentrations were tested, following standard protocols, and using the standard OECD soil as a test substrate (5% of organic matter). The aqueous suspensions of SDS/DDAB, used to spike the soils, were characterised by light scattering techniques for hydrodynamic size of the vesicles, aggregation index, polydispersity index, zeta potential and surface charge. The SDS/DDAB concentrations in the test soil were analysed by HPLC-UV at the end of the assays. Invertebrate species were revealed to be sensitive to nano-SDS/DDAB upon immediate exposure to freshly spiked soils. However, the degradation of SDS/DDAB nano-vesicles in the soil with time prevented the occurrence of significant reproduction effects on soil invertebrates. Plants were not particularly sensitive to SDS/DDAB, except B. oleracea (at concentrations above 375 mg kg− 1dw). The results gathered in this study allowed a preliminary determination of a risk limit to nano-SDS/DDAB.

In addition to the DFT calculations for discovering new energetic levels introduced in TiO2 by codoping, various characterization techniques were used to determine the dopant lattice sites in TiO2 and interactions between them; and also determining their consequences on electronic, morphological, structural, and optical properties. At low concentration of B-doping (1 at.%), B occupies the interstitial site (Bint), but as the concentration increases (2 at.% and 3 at.%) B also occupies substitutional O position (Bsub) in addition to Bint to form TiO2 containing Bint+sub. Both these B-doped TiO2 showed improved photocatalytic activity attributed to effective charge separation obtained for TiO2–Bint due to the formation of shallow energy level while higher visible light absorption is achieved with TiO2–Bint+sub owing to the presence of two deep energy levels in the band gap as confirmed by DFT calculations. In the case of Co doping, the band gap of TiO2 is reduced but the recombination rates are always high and are caused by the formation of Co states in the band gap. For Co monodoped TiO2, the photocatalytic activity is low for all the concentrations considered, except for very low concentration of Co (0.1 at.%). Two opposite effects were observed when small amount of Co (0.1 at.%) was codoped with Bint or Bint+sub. In particular, the photocatalytic degradation rate of organic aqueous pollutants (p-nitrophenol and rhodamine B dye) reduces for TiO2–Co–Bint whereas it is enhanced remarkably for TiO2–Co–Bint+sub as compared to (Co or B) monodoped (∼2.1 times) and undoped (∼7.8 times) TiO2. Higher photocatalytic activity observed in Co-doped TiO2–Bint+sub is discussed in terms of the interactions of Co with B at two different lattice positions in TiO2 and the synergistic effect created by higher visible light absorption and the improved charge separation.",,,,,0.0,

River waters were directly filtered on the field and high efficiency well-type Ge detectors were used to analyse radiocaesium concentrations in very small quantities of suspended particles and filtered water (a few mg to a few g). For such base-flow conditions, our results show that the watersheds studied present similar hydro-sedimentary behaviours at their outlets and that the exports of dissolved and particulate radiocaesium are comparable. Moreover, the contribution of these rivers to the instantaneous export of radiocaesium to the ocean is similar to that of the Abukuma River. Our preliminary results indicate that, in the estuaries, radiocaesium concentrations in suspended sediments would be reduced by more than 80%, while radiocaesium concentration in filtered waters would be maintained. Significant correlations between radiocaesium concentrations and radiocaesium inventories in the soils of the catchments indicate that there was at that time little intra and inter-watershed variability in the transfer processes of radiocaesium from lands to rivers at this regional scale. The apparent liquid–solid partition coefficient (KD) values acquired for the lowest loads/finest particles complement the values acquired by using sediment traps and highlight the strong capacity of the smallest particles to transfer radiocaesium. Finally, but not least, our observations suggest that there could be a significant transfer of highly contaminated detrital biomass from forest litter to the downstream rivers in a rather conservative way.",,,,,0.0,

Triphenylamine derivatives are commonly used in a hole-transport material for organic photoconductors of laser-beam printers, in which the materials are used as an amorphous form. For developing organic photovoltaics using the photoconductor’s technology, preparation of a single crystal seems to be a specific way by realizing the high mobility of an organic semiconductor. In this study, a single crystal of 4-(2,2-diphenylethenyl)-N,N-bis(4-methylphenyl)-benzenamine (TPA) was prepared and its anisotropic hole-transport property measured. First, the hole-transport property of the TPA was investigated based on its chemical structure and electrochemical redox characteristics. Next, a large-scale single crystal formation at a high rate was developed by employing a solution method based on its solubility and supersolubility curves. The grown TPA was found to be a single crystal based on the polarization micrograph observation and crystallographic analysis. For the TPA single crystal, an anisotropic surface conduction was found, which was well explained by its molecular stack structure.

Such CDOM can lead to unpleasant taste and odor of the water and produce undesirable disinfection byproducts during drinking water treatment. We studied the drinking water Lake Qiandao, China, and found that the concentrations of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the lake increased significantly with inflow rate (p < 0.001). Similarly, close relationships between inflow rate and the CDOM absorption coefficient at 350 nm a(350) and with terrestrial humic-like fluorescence C3 and a negative relationship between inflow rate and the first principal component (PC1) scores, which, in turn, were negatively related to the concentrations and relative molecular size of CDOM (p < 0.001), i.e. the concentration and molecular size of CDOM entering the lake increased proportionately with inflow rate. Furthermore, stable isotopes (δD and δ18O) were depleted in the upstream river mouth relative to downstream remaining lake regions, substantiating that riverine CDOM entering the lake was probably driven by inflow rate. This was further underpinned by remarkably higher mean chlorophyll-a and in situ measured terrestrial CDOM fluorescence (365/480 nm) and apparent oxygen utilization (AOU), and notably lower mean PC1 and CDOM spectral slope (S275–295) recorded in the upstream river mouth than in the downstream main lake area. Strong negative correlations between inflow rate and a(250):a(365), S275–295, and the spectral slope ratio (SR) implied that CDOM input to the lake in rainy period was dominated by larger organic molecules with a more humic-like character.

This study was carried out with a single shot laser on samples covered by a layer made of a mixture of the cinnabar pigment and different binders. Three wavelengths based on Nd: YAG laser were investigated (1064, 532 and 266 nm). The plasma is controlled at the same electron temperature after an adjustment of pulse energy for these three wavelengths on a fresco sample without organic binder. This approach allows to eliminate the effects of laser pulse energy and the material laser absorption. Afterwards, the emission spectra were compared to separate different techniques. The organic binding media has been separated based on the relative emission intensity of the present CN or C2 rovibrational emissions. In order to test the capability of separating or identifying, the chemometric approach (PCA) was applied to the different matrix. The different solutions in term of wavelength range to optimise the identification was investigated. We focused on the evaluation for the laser wavelength to insure a better separation. The different capacity was interpreted by differentiating the binders by the altered interaction mechanisms between the laser photon and the binders.

Here, we introduce a concept for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) where the layer sequence is restructured in order to concentrate and maximize the current flow in a metal-free area. Thus, we do not only avoid parasitic absorption by the metal electrodes, but also drastically reduce the power dissipation. These devices enable higher current densities than the standard OLED design due to reduced self-heating as a consequence of an active area which automatically shrinks down to an appropriate size. They further allow for integration into an organic microcavity. Therefore, the new concept is well suited to realize an electrically driven OSL in future.",,,,,,1.0

Organic matter management is known to affect aggregate stability against breakdown, but little is known about how this translates into rainfall-induced aggregate fragmentation and sediment transport under field conditions. In this study, we performed field experiments in which artificial rainfall was applied after pre-wetting on three pairs of arable soil plots (1.5 × 0.75 m) six weeks after incorporating a mixture of grass and wheat straw into the topsoil of one plot in each pair (OI treatment) but not on the other plot (NI treatment). Artificial rainfall was applied for approximately 2 h on each pair at an intensity of 49.1 mm h− 1. In both treatments, discharge and sediment concentration in the discharge were correlated and followed a similar temporal pattern after the onset of surface runoff: After a sharp increase at the beginning both approached a steady state. But the onset of runoff was more delayed on the OI plots, and the discharge and sediment concentration were in average only roughly half as high on the OI as on the NI plots. With increasing discharge the fraction of coarse sediment increased. This relationship did not differ between the two treatments. Thus, due to the lower discharge, the fraction of fine particles in the exported sediment was larger in the runoff from the OI plots than from the NI plots. The later runoff onset and lower discharge rate was related to a higher initial aggregate stability on the OI plots. Terrestrial laser scanning proved to be a very valuable method to map changes in the micro-topography of the soil surfaces. It revealed a much less profound decrease in surface roughness on the OI than on the NI plots.",,,,,,0.0

The analysis of the slope ratios shows that the wavelength-dependent absorption behavior of soot does not depend on the soot volume fraction or the soot particle size; rather, the slope ratio depends only on the soot’s refractive index, which in turn is related to its OC contents.

The effects of incidence angle variation on seam appearance, cross-sectional shape, joint mechanical properties and microstructure of weldments were analyzed. In addition, the main factors influencing the value of incidence angle were investigated. According to the results, the weld seams had a good appearance as well as a fine, and uniform microstructure when the laser beam incidence angle was smaller than the critical incidence angle, and thus they could withstand great tensile and shear loads. Moreover, all tensile–shear specimens were fractured in the base material zone.

It is found by UV–Vis absorption spectroscopic analysis that chlrophyll-a, chlrophyll-b and carotenoid are present in the pigment extract with 56%, 25% and 19%, respectively.

A cold pressed, homogeneous mixture of Fe and H3BO3 (Fe + H3BO3) was used as a target in PLD to deposit the coatings in O2 atmosphere. Phase explosion phenomenon provided by laser ablation on the target, allowed to form rough, porous and embedded metallic Fe particulates coating with H3BO3 as background on a glass substrate. Subsequent thermal annealing of the as deposited Fe + H3BO3 coating at 600 °C, led to formation of crystalline, hierarchical 3D nanostructured features with nanowires, nanorods, and nanosheets grown from the spherical particulates. Characterization by XRD, Micro-Raman, XPS, SEM and KPM analysis provided information on the systematic phase and morphology transformation from metallic Fe to hierarchical Iron oxide. Stress-induced phase segregation and stress release process during thermal annealing are suggested as the growth mechanism for the nanostructures. Photocatalytic activity measurements were studied with the coating in presence of Methylene Blue dye through Photo-Fenton process. To understand the effect of precursors, morphology, and synthesis technique (physical and chemical), similar hematite nanostructures were also prepared by thermal annealing of as deposited metallic Fe coating, hematite nanoparticles assembled coating by PLD, and by hydrothermal chemical method respectively. All these coatings showed less photocatalytic activity as compared to the hematite coating obtained from thermal annealing of Fe + H3BO3 sample. A series of various parameters such as effect of H2O2 concentration, effect of pH, water medium and recyclability tests for 10 times were performed, and all revealed promising results in terms of enhanced activity and high mechanical stability of the coatings.

In the case of fs laser irradiation of hexane, polyynes were produced efficiently much more than the ns-laser case, whereas for the toluene target, polyynes were not produced.

Herein, a near-infrared (NIR) laser-activated “nanobomb” was developed as a noninvasive and targeted physical therapeutic strategy to effectively disrupt tumor neovasculature in an accurate and expeditious manner. This “nanobomb” was rationally fabricated via the encapsulation of vinyl azide (VA) into c(RGDfE) peptide-functionalized, hollow copper sulfide (HCuS) nanoparticles. The resulting RGD@HCuS(VA) was selectively internalized into integrin αvβ3-expressing tumor vasculature endothelial cells and dramatically increased the photoacoustic signals from the tumor neovasculature, achieving a maximum signal-to-noise ratio at 4 h post-injection. Upon NIR irradiation, the local temperature increase triggered VA to release N2 bubbles rapidly. Subsequently, these N2 bubbles could instantly explode to destroy the neovasculature and further induce necrosis of the surrounding tumor cells. A single-dose injection of RGD@HCuS(VA) led to complete tumor regression after laser irradiation, with no tumor regrowth for 30 days. More importantly, high-resolution photoacoustic angiography, combined with excellent biodegradability, facilitated the precise destruction of tumor neovasculature by RGD@HCuS(VA) without damaging normal tissues. These results demonstrate the great potential of this “nanobomb” for clinical translation to treat cancer patients with NIR laser-accessible orthotopic tumors.",,,,,,0.0

However, the direct analysis of small molecule with MALDI-TOF-MS remains a challenge due to the matrix interference in the low mass region. In this paper, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs: MOF-5, MOF-235, Cu-btc MOFs and Uio-66(Zr)-2OH) were successfully used as both adsorbent and significant matrix of MALDI-TOF-MS method for the analysis of small molecule pollutants.

Three laser beams, an infrared 1064-nm beam for the MAPLE and two 532-nm beams for the PLD targets, were concurrently used in the process. A new target holder with remote control of the target tilt was designed to provide overlapping of the plumes from the three targets and uniform mixing of the additives in the polymer film. The fabricated nano-composite films were characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the measurement of the quantum efficiency (QE) of the upconversion fluorescence. The films retained the crystalline structure of the inorganic additives. The size of the nano-particles varied in the range 10–200 nm. Upconversion QE of the films was an order of magnitude less than that of the bulk phosphor, which can be explained by lesser number of the rare-earth ions in the nano-particles in the polymer film than in the micro-grains of the bulk phosphor. The AZO additive increased QE by 1.6 times to (0.072 ± 0.022) % more likely due to the plasmonic enhancement of the local optical infra-red pump (980 nm) field.

The effects of two commonly used automotive lubricants, Bonderite L-FM MP-404 and Ferrocote 61 MAL HCL lubricant, on the weld quality were investigated. Images captured by a CCD camera showed that the presence of lubricant caused the poor wetting and spreading of the filler wire. The decomposition of lubricant formed hydrogen pores in the weld, promoted the plasma plume with a high intensity, and elevated the temperature of the molten pool. The simulation of rapid solidification revealed that the formation mechanism of pores was related to the temperature distributions and the solidification rates. The comparison of effects of diluted lubricants in different concentrations on the weld surface quality and the mechanical properties provides a reference on an acceptable level of lubricant on the stamped panels prior to welding.",,,,,,0.0

Further, hybrids of these plasmonic structures were prepared with an organic dye Eosin yellow (EY), to investigate the morphology effect of plasmonic structures on plasmonic–organic hybrids in terms of their linear extinction spectra and two photon absorption coefficients. The NLO investigations were conducted using 20 ps laser pulses of wavelength 532 nm as an excitation source in single beam Z-scan setup.

In the subsoil, in contrast, the variation of maize C incorporation into the SOC pool was controlled by variations in maize yield (R2 = 0.44), which also exhibited a pronounced spatial variability (0.84 to 1.94 kg dry biomass m−2), and which was negatively correlated with the amount of rock fragments (R2 = 0.48, p < 0.001). We assume that heterogeneous input of belowground root biomass blurs the causal interactions between the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties and the related patterns of SOC turnover, and conclude that spatial patterns of SOC turnover are not easily predictable by standard soil analyses.",,,,,,0.0

The intracellular imaging results were carried out by flow cytometry based on four different kinds of cell lines (including three adherent cell lines and one suspension cell line). Compared with free pyropheophorbide-a, CNH-Pyro demonstrated enhanced photodynamic tumor ablation efficiency during in vitro experiments due to improved biocompatibility of the hybrid nanomaterial and the photothermal therapy effect derived from carbon-network structure.

Significant changes were observed for oxygen growth pressures below ~ 10 Pa. In this pressure range, the morphology changed from nanocrystalline to that of a continuous film with a shift of the growth orientation of the crystalline fraction of the deposit from c-plane to m-plane. The appearance of valley-shaped surface cracks caused a significant increase of rms surface roughness, reduced hydrophobicity and shift to hydrophilicity at 0.13 Pa. The visible optical transmittance of the film reduced from an average of 90% to 65% and the orange/red deep level emission was quenched. The electrical properties showed decreasing resistivities (105 Ω cm to 10− 3 Ω cm) and Hall mobilities (35 cm2/V-s to 3 cm2/V-s) and increasing carrier concentrations (1011 cm− 3 to 1021 cm− 3).

This situation is caused by insufficient basic knowledge of conditions and parameters of high-temperature (over 500 °C) heating and evaporation of water and water-based emulsions, solutions, and slurries. Limited information is available regarding the evaporation rates dependent on the temperature of gaseous medium. Consequently, the up-to-date evaporation models allow the researchers to achieve adequate values (in good agreement with the experiment) of evaporation rates at air temperatures not exceeding 300–400 °C. The paper presents a set of experiments on water droplets with the size ranging from 1 to 2 mm, which is used to create the information database on high-temperature evaporation parameters. The approach to measuring the evaporation rate involves observation of the droplet size or more exactly its mean radius, and recording the time of its existence. A high-speed video camera and Tema Automotive software with different tracking algorithms are used for experimental observations. During gas heating, the distribution of highly non-homogeneous and non-steady temperature field in evaporating water droplets is detected by the hardware and software cross-correlation system and Planar Laser-induced Fluorescence optical diagnostics. Instantaneous and medium evaporation rates are computed for the whole period of the droplet lifetime. Highly nonlinear evaporation rate dependences are suggested for gas temperatures and the water droplet surface, size, and time of gas heating. Approximate relationships are described for the prediction of evaporation rates depending on the basic parameters. The evaporation rate is shown to increase several-fold during the heating of a water droplet in a high-temperature gaseous medium. The experimental data are described most accurately by exponential dependences of water evaporation rate versus the airflow temperature and velocity. This result makes it possible to predict the corresponding highly nonlinear dependences of evaporation rate versus the density of convective heat flux and the overall thermal conditions in the industrial chambers, evaporators, heat exchangers, etc. The mathematical expressions obtained can be used to identify the effective conditions of water droplet heating in a large group of high-temperatures applications as well as for developing high-temperature liquid evaporation models.",,,,,,0.0

Using thin liquid layers a significant increase in nanoparticle productivity (up to 5 times) is obtained. This increase is attributed to the dynamics, shape of the cavitation bubble and the spring-board like behavior of the wires in the small liquid filament. It is found that despite the increase in productivity, the particle size is independent of the productivity-related ablation parameters such as repetition rate, liquid layer thickness and wire diameter. In addition to the cavitation bubble, further shielding effects have been related to both, the laser ablated material and the presence of generated small vapor bubbles.

Adapting their parameter sets and classifiers to match changing field situation is laborious, yet it is required for practical application. Pixel-based classification allows adjusting the classifier model in the field easily by adding a few marks to sample data; however, pixel-based classification of camera data for crop/weed discrimination is impractical, as pixel features lack descriptiveness. This paper contributes a multi-wavelength laser line profile (MWLP) system for scanning the plants and obtaining sensor data, yielding image-based 3D range data, matched spectral reflectance, and scattering data at multiple wavelengths for each pixel. Using these descriptive pixel features, pixel-based Bayesian classification for crop/weed discrimination requires very few field-specific label data, thus allowing In-Field-Labeling for classifier adaptation to specific field situations. For different field situations and two different crops (carrots (Daucus carota) and corn salad (Valerianella locusta)) the classification using spectral and 3D features applying classifiers generated from very few marks in sample data (i.e., with very little effort for labeling), was successfully demonstrated, thereby achieving misclassification rates comparable to the best literature values.",,,,,,0.0

The organic additives consisted of Olive Stone Flour (OSF), with round-shape particles of 55 µm, and Wheat Straw (WS), with 877 µm particles in the form of fibers. It was found that the combustion of OSF and WS resulted in a porosity formation during the firing process. The morphology of these pores corresponded to that of the organic additives. Therefore, the addition of small OSF particles decreased the median pore size of the clay ceramic. It improved the mechanical strength of the clay ceramic by 12% for an 8 wt% addition of OSF. On the other hand, the WS fibers increased the clay ceramic anisotropy. This resulted in a 41% improvement of the thermal conductivity using an 8 wt% addition of WS. Finally, a model was developed from these experimental results to predict the thermal conductivity and the mechanical strength of the clay ceramic with other organic additives. They were predicted from the parameters of the organic additives (i.e., true density, swelling degree, particle size distribution, particle shape factor).

However, hadal trenches, which represent the deepest portion of the hydrosphere on Earth, do not abide by this universal rule. It has been speculated that hadal trenches would serve as organic matter depocenters, where bacteria-mediated organic matter degradation intensifies. Here we examine the contents of total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN), as well as the δ13C values of TOC in three gravity cores, two box cores, and three grab samples with water depth from 4900 to 7118 m, in order to reveal the provenances of organic matter, spatial distribution and accumulation rates of particulate organic carbon (POC) in the southern Mariana Trench rim and slope. Although the deepest area was not sampled, trench rim and slope is also of importance in terms of transportation and accumulation processes of organic matter. A vast majority of the sediment samples have bulk TOC/TN molar ratios and δ13C values of TOC ranging from 4.2 to 11 and from − 21.8 to − 18.9‰, respectively, implying that the organic matter was primarily sourced from marine algae. Two exceptions have been found at 101 cm and 201 cm depths of core GC05 with a possible input of terrestrial material suggested by an abrupt increase in TOC contents and TOC/TN molar ratios accompanied by marked decreases in δ13C values of TOC. Moreover, TOC contents in surface sediments basically increased with water depth. Based on the published excess 210Pb data and by assuming a simplified one-dimensional sediment loading despite of frequent occurrences of mass wasting transports in hadal trenches, the sedimentation rate in the southern Challenger Deep (6037 m) was estimated to be 0.02 cm yr− 1. This much higher sedimentation rate compared to the globally averaged values in deep ocean sediments coupled with the trend of increasing in TOC contents with water depth may serve as evidence for the lateral transport of sediment particles induced by the funnel-like topography and localized current dynamics within the trench. The average POC accumulation rate within the southern Challenger Deep roughly amounts to 1.5 × 10− 5 g cm− 2 yr− 1, equivalent to about a seventh of the globally averaged POC accumulation rate in deep-ocean seafloor.

Here, we conducted a multi-scale/multi-technique comparative study of the organic matter (OM) from two CM chondrites (that originate from the same parent body or from identical parent bodies that accreted the same mixture of precursors) and underwent a different degree of hydrothermal alteration: Paris (a weakly altered CM chondrite – CM 2.8) and Murchison (a more altered one – CM 2.5). The Paris insoluble organic matter (IOM) shows a higher aliphatic/aromatic carbon ratio, a higher radical abundance and a lower oxygen content than the Murchison IOM. Analysis of the OM in situ shows that two texturally distinct populations of organic compounds are present within the Paris matrix: sub-micrometric individual OM particles and diffuse OM finely distributed within phyllosilicates and amorphous silicates. These results indicate that hydrothermal alteration on the CM parent body induced aromatization and oxidation of the IOM, as well as a decrease in radical and nitrogen contents. Some of these observations were also reported by studies of variably altered fragment of Tagish Lake (C2), although the hydrothermal alteration of the OM in Tagish Lake was apparently much more severe. Finally, comparison with data available in the literature suggests that the parent bodies of other chondrite petrologic groups could have accreted a mixture of organic precursors different from that accreted by the parent body of CMs.",,,,,,0.0

The aim of this work was to evaluate the feasibility of LIBS as an at-line tool for IF manufacturing. To this end, IF mixtures with varying content of calcium were prepared over a range (approx. 1.5–7 mg/g of calcium) selected to be in conformity with the guidelines provided by the Codex Alimentarius Commission.

In this study, we presented an efficient, facile and environment-friendly strategy to produce polymer-FONs, which relied on the self-polymerization of dopamine and polyethyleneimine (PEI) in rather mild conditions. To obtain the final polymer-FONs, aldehyde group-containing copolymers (named as poly(UA-co-PEGMA)) were synthesized by reversible addition–fragmentation chain-transfer polymerization using polyethylene glycol methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA) and 1-undecen-10-al (UA) as monomers.

Whether ESBL/AmpC also occur in organic dairy herds, which have restricted AMU, is not known. Additionally, it is unknown whether, in addition to restricted AMU, other factors in organic herd management are associated with ESBL/AmpC herd status. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of ESBL/AmpC in organic dairy herds in the Netherlands. Subsequently, the relationships between the ESBL/AmpC herd status and AMU and between ESBL/AmpC herd status and farmers’ management were assessed in organic dairy herds. For this study, 90 randomly selected, officially registered organic dairy herds were included. The ESBL/AmpC herd status was determined based on the bacteriological culture result of a slurry sample. The sensitivity of testing slurry samples for ESBL/AmpC herd status is less than 100% for detecting herds with a low ESBL/AmpC prevalence. For that reason, herds that tested positive for ESBL/AmpC in slurry were defined as positive and herds with negative slurry samples were defined as unsuspected. A comprehensive questionnaire on management practices was conducted and records on specified antimicrobials that were provided to these herds by the veterinary service providers were obtained. From the data on antimicrobial supplies by the veterinarian, the animal daily defined dose of antimicrobials per farm per year (DDDAF) was calculated. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the relation between the ESBL/AmpC herd status and DDDAF. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate management factors associated with the ESBL/AmpC herd status. We found ESBL/AmpC in 12 of the 90 (13%; 95% confidence interval = 7–22%) slurry samples from organic dairy herds. The median DDDAF in organic dairy herds was 0.5, which was not significantly different between ESBL/AmpC-positive and unsuspected dairy herds. No association could be found between the use of different types of antimicrobials, such as third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, and ESBL/AmpC herd status. Factors that were associated with higher odds of being ESBL/AmpC-positive were pig farms located within a 2-km radius of the barn, applying parental treatment for clinical mastitis, and providing milk replacer to the female calves after colostrum intake. The prevalence of ESBL/AmpC in organic dairy herds appeared lower than the prevalence in previous studies conducted in conventional dairy herds.

Suspended and deposited sediments, filtered water, macro organic debris and dead leaves were sampled along the six most contaminated coastal river catchments of the Fukushima prefecture in the early autumns 2013 and 2014. Radiocesium concentrations of river samples and total organic carbon concentrations in suspended and deposited sediments were measured. Radiocesium concentrations of suspended and deposited sediments were significantly correlated to 137Cs inventories in soils and total organic carbon. The distributions of radiocesium between the organic and mineral phases of both types of sediment were assessed by using a modelling approach. The results suggest that, during the early autumn season, the organic fraction was the main phase that carried the radiocesiums in deposited sediments and in suspended sediments for suspended loads < 25 mg·L− 1. For higher suspended loads like those occurring during typhoon periods, the mineral fraction was the main carrier phase. Thus, high apparent distribution coefficient values noted by various authors in Fukushima could be attributed to the high radiocesium contents of particulate organic matter. Since it is well known that organic compounds generally do not significantly adsorb radiocesium onto specific sites, several hypotheses are suggested: 1) Radiocesiums may have been absorbed into organic components at the early stage of atmospheric radioactive deposits and/or later due to biomass recycling and 2) Those elements would be partly carried by glassy hot particles together with organic matter transported by rivers in Fukushima. Both hypotheses would lead to conserve the amount of radiocesiums associated with particles during their transfers from the contaminated areas to the marine environment. Finally, such organically bound radiocesium would lead to significant deliveries of bioavailable radiocesium for living organisms at Fukushima.",,,,,,0.0

Here we compared photovoltaic properties of YD-TRC-NMF with those of other four D-TRC-A2 systems, which replaced indoline with triphenylamine (MTPA) and fullerene with perylene bisimide or anthraquinone (AEAQ), indicating that long-lived CS states are playing an important role in promoting photoelectric conversion in YD-TRC-AEAQ (or NMF) and MTPA-TRC-AEAQ, in which the short-circuit current and photoelectric conversion efficiency were significantly improved in comparison with YD-TRC and MTPA-TRC, respectively, due to triplet states of A2 being higher than charge-separated states.

Studies have been carried out by means of UV–vis absorption, steady-state fluorescence and fluorescence anisotropy, time-resolved fluorescence and fluorescence anisotropy, and dynamic light scattering measurements. The rate of solvation increases in the order C16TABr < C16TANO3 < (C16TA)2SO4 < C16TAp-TS. Effectively, the solvation process is controlled by the extent of release of water molecules during the formation of micelles which depends on the nature of counterion. p-TS− counterions are more tightly bound to the headgroups because of added effect of its hydrophobic part. Counterions indirectly contribute to the slow solvation by the formation of clusters of water molecules. The decreasing order of the average rotational relaxation time of C-480 in the micelles of surfactants is C16TAp-TS >> C16TABr > C16TANO3 > (C16TA)2SO4, which is the same as the decreasing order of microviscosity of micelles. The rotational relaxation time is shorter in the micelles of (C16TA)2SO4 as compared to C16TAp-TS as the former micelles have less tightly packed structure than the latter. The slow rotational relaxation is mainly contributed by the lateral diffusion of C-480 along the surface of the micelle. The rotational motion is the slowest for the micelle of (C16TA)2SO4, and the same is the fastest for the micelle of C16TABr. There is an indication of different orientation of C-480 molecules in viscous micelles of C16TAp-TS as compared to other less viscous micelles.

The chemical and structural differences of these NOMs were compared with the Suwannee River humic acid (SRHA) SRHA using 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and Fourier transforms infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy.

Despite the importance of soil erosion, surprisingly few studies have evaluated the sources of eroded carbon (C). This study used natural abundance levels of the stable isotope signature (13C) and radioactive isotopes (137Cs and 210Pbex), along with elements ratio (C/N) based on a two end member mixing model to qualitatively and quantitatively identify the sources of sedimentary OC retained by check dam in the Qiaozigou small watershed in the Loess Plateau, China. Sediment profiles (0–200 cm) captured at natural depositional area of the basin was compared to possible source materials, which included: superficial Loess mineral soils (0–20 cm) from three land use types [i.e., grassland (Medicago sativa), forestland (Robinia pseudoacacia.), shrubland (Prunus sibirica), and gully land (Loess parent material.)]. The results demonstrated that SOC in sediments showed significantly negative correlation with pH (P < 0.01), and positive correlation with soil water content (SWC) (P < 0.05). The sedimentary OC was not derived from grasslands or gullies. Forestland and shrubland were two main sources of eroded organic carbon within the surface sediment (0–60 cm deep), except for that in the 20–40 cm soil layer. Radionuclides analyses also implied that the surface sediments retained by check-dams mainly originated from soils of forestland and shrubland. Results of the two end-member mixing model demonstrated that more than 50% SOC (mean probability estimate (MPE) 50.13% via 13C and 60.53% via C/N) in surface sediment (0–20 cm deep) derived from forestland, whereas subsurface sedimentary SOC (20–200 cm) mainly resulted from shrubland (MPE > 50%). Although uncertainties on the sources of SOC in deep soils exist, the soil organic δ13C and C/N is still an effective indicator for sources of sedimentary organic carbon in the deposition zone in the short term (<10 years).",,,,,,0.0

However, in soils that experience periodic fluctuations in redox conditions the interaction between DOC and Fe (hydr)oxides may not only involve organic coatings on mineral surfaces, but also Fe-DOC coprecipitates that form during the oxidation of soil solutions containing important amounts of DOC and Fe2+. The aim of this work is to provide new insights into the mechanisms involved, and the amount and selectivity of C retained during the coprecipitation process. A series of Fe-OM associations with increasing C loading was synthesized at pH 6 by surface adsorption or coprecipitation (oxidation of ferrous iron) utilizing rice-straw derived dissolved organic matter. The kinetics of Fe2+ oxidation and complexation, and the total and selective retention of DOC during the coprecipitation process were evaluated. Moreover, synthesized associations, as well as a field coprecipitate collected in situ from a paddy soil, were studied by X-ray diffraction, N2 gas adsorption-desorption isotherms, electrophoretic mobility measurements and thermogravimetric analyses. Coprecipitation resulted in higher organic C contents (49–213 mg g−1) with respect to adsorbed systems (18–47 mg g−1), and favoured the inclusion of OM within highly aggregated associations having particularly low BET specific surface areas. Although coprecipitation led to a strong, selective retention of aromatic constituents, the initial complexation of Fe2+ by aliphatic carboxylic moieties and precipitation as C-rich Fe-OM associations contributed to the total C retention, particularly at higher solution C/Fe ratios. These aliphatic complexes formed during coprecipitation may play an important, though often underestimated, role in C stabilization in soils experiencing frequent redox fluctuations and often characterized by elevated soluble Fe2+ and DOC concentrations.",,,,,,0.0

One key focus area for the application of ALS data is the assessment of riparian ecosystems, due to their critical role for providing, regulating and supporting important ecosystem services. ALS data provide detailed and accurate digital terrain models (DTMs) under forest canopy, which in turn enable the characterization of detailed stream networks, stream properties, and associated vegetation characteristics in adjacent riparian ecotones. In a complex Pacific Northwest coastal forest, we demonstrate how ALS point clouds can be used to map a stream network and characterize stream properties including stream order, width, gradient, sinuosity, and solar shading. Of relevance to regulatory and sustainability related elements of forest management, we demonstrate the use of these data to identify stream classes and related riparian zones, as well as the fish-bearing potential of the stream. The total length of identified streams was 6421.8 km, of which 55% were of the lowest order streams. The median stream gradient was 16.4% with median stream width varying between 0.58 and 19.67 m for the smallest to largest streams respectively. Stream class and fish bearing potential were evaluated using independent data, with overall accuracies of 61.0% for stream class and 82.9% for fish-bearing potential. The median of stand height, canopy cover, and stand vertical variability within riparian management areas was 19.8 m, 88.6%, and 68%, respectively, and in general did not vary across stream orders.

The North polar region does not show this behavior, nor do South polar surfaces at latitudes more than 5° from the pole. This South pole reflectance anomaly persists when analysis is limited to surfaces with slopes less than 10° to eliminate false detection due to the brightening effect of mass wasting, and also when the very bright south polar crater Shackleton is excluded from the analysis. We also find that south polar regions of permanent shadow that have been reported to be generally brighter at 1064 nm do not show anomalous reflectance when their annual maximum surface temperatures are too high to preserve water ice. This distinction is not observed at the North Pole. The reflectance excursion on surfaces with maximum temperatures below 110 K is superimposed on a general trend of increasing reflectance with decreasing maximum temperature that is present throughout the polar regions in the north and south; we attribute this trend to a temperature or illumination-dependent space weathering effect (e.g. Hemingway et al., 2015). We also find a sudden increase in reflectance with decreasing temperature superimposed on the general trend at 200 K and possibly at 300 K.

We studied this stabilization in: 1) a managed (thinned and mowed) English oak (Quercus robur L.) plantation; 2) a similarly managed 1:1 mixed plantation of Italian alder (Alnus cordata Loisel.) and English oak; 3) an unmanaged portion of the mixed plantation; 4) a yearly tilled and manured cropland; 5) an adjacent forest growing on a natural soil, which served as a term of reference. We focused on water-stable soil aggregates, in which SOM is physically protected from decay. Aggregates of 0.5 to 1.0 mm in diameter were subjected to Low-Temperature Ashing (LTA) by oxygen plasma, a technique able to progressively remove SOM with minimal or no damage to mineral constituents and soil fabric. All minesoils had behaved as C sinks, although to a different extent depending on land use, with cropland storing around half soil C than the afforested areas. Carbon enrichment improved soil structure promoting the formation of large and water-stable soil aggregates. The C contained in the core of these aggregates, measured here as the one able to resist 48 h of LTA treatment and confidently assumed as the C fraction best protected from decay, ranged from 43 to 70% of total C, depending on land use and horizon. The strict relationships found between the amount of “protected” SOM and the median diameter (d50) of water-stable soil aggregates (R2 = 0.88), on the one hand, and the larger class of pores in water-stable soil macroaggregates (R2 = 0.99), on the other hand, demonstrated the crucial role of this SOM pool in soil structure formation. This study showed the potential of LTA used in combination with laser diffraction analysis, FTIR-PAS spectroscopy, and mercury intrusion porosimetry to distinguish C stocks benefiting from different physical protection in aggregates and to assess their role in soil structure formation.

Desorption of analyte, including trace organic species, may be increased by coupling the wavelength of the desorption laser to IR absorption features associated with vibration transitions of minerals or organic functional groups. We demonstrate this effect on minerals relevant to icy bodies, doped with the aromatic amino acid tryptophan, and find a correlation between the optimal L2MS desorption laser wavelength for organic detection and the presence of vibrational transitions in the mineral substrate.

Although CO2 laser engraving is an efficient method for thermoplastic device fabrication, it accompanies with poor bonding issues due to severe bulging and large feature size determined by the diameter of laser beam. In this study, a low-cost microfabrication method is proposed by reversibly sealing a 1 mm thick polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) over an engraving substrate to reduce channel feature size and minimize bulges of laser engraved channels. PMMA, polycarbonate (PC), polystyrene (PS), perfluoroalkoxy alkane (PFA), cyclic-olefin polymers (COP) and polylactic acid (PLA) were found compatible with this sacrificial layer assisted laser engraving technique. Microchannel width as small as ∼40 μm was attainable by a laser beam that was 5 times larger in diameter. Bulging height was significantly reduced to less 5 μm for most substrates, which facilitated leak proof device bonding without channel deformation. Microdevices with high aspect ratio channels were prepared to demonstrate the applicability of this microfabrication method. We believe this fast and low-cost fabrication approach for thermoplastics will be of interest to researchers who have encountered problem with polydimethylsiloxane based microdevices in their applications.",,,,,,0.0

In this study, grid patterns were first fabricated on aluminum using a nanosecond pulsed laser, and then additional post-processing without any chemicals was used. Under heat treatment, the surface became superhydrophobic with a contact angle (CA) greater than 150° and a sliding angle (SA) lower than 10°. Conversely, when immersed in boiling water, the surface became superhydrophilic with a low contact angle. The mechanism for wettability change was also explained.

Laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and UV/Vis detectors were employed to observe both the migration time of organic dyes and the electroosmotic flow (EOF) in NACE, respectively. As seen in conventional aqueous BGE, the mobility of EOF in organic solvents tended to rise when the ratio between the dielectric constant and the solvent’s viscosity (ε/η) increased in accordance with Smoluchowski’s equation. However, unlike the ε/η of pure organic solvents, the migration order of dyes changed as follows: methanol (60.0) > DMF (45.8) > ethanol (22.8) > DMSO (23.4) > 2-propanol (9.8).

The concentration and distribution of graphene sheets in SiC matrixes were controlled by changing total pressure (Ptot) in the reaction chamber. The investigation of growth mechanism showed that the photolytic of laser played an important role during the depositions. Observation by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) revealed that graphene nucleated on SiC(111) lattice planes. As the increase of Ptot, the concentration of graphene decreased and the grain size of SiC grains and graphene sheets increased. The distribution of graphene in SiC matrix significantly affected the electrical conductivity (σ) of the composite coating.

Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) is a powerful tool for in situ analyses of small samples at micrometer levels. Here we report in situ analyses of fluid inclusions using LA-ICP-MS method. NIST SRM glasses and 23Na are generally used as external and internal standards for LA-ICP-MS analysis of fluid inclusion, respectively, although the RSD of microthermometric estimation of 23Na is about 20% and even worse, the background signal of Na is high for most ICP-MS. Using well-characterized natural fluids inclusion, we show that RESOlution S-155 laser system analyze fluid inclusions in quartz and determine the trace element concentrations. Resonetics RESOlution S-155 laser has the advantage of the motorized Z stage can be used to accommodate variation of sample height or sample topography and height difference between samples, which is very important for analyzing the fluid inclusion in quartz. Our results suggest laser energy density is 25 J/cm2, laser pulse repetition rates are commonly between 6 and 10 Hz to avoid the fissuring of quartz and obtain adequate results. For this LA-ICP-MS analysis, uncertainty on 35Cl content is around 40% because of intensity of the 35Cl signal is three orders of magnitude less intense than the intensity of the 23Na signal. Nevertheless, it is still a useful reference for fluid inclusion analyses in addition to 23Na.

It was demonstrated that the electron dynamics in the ablated fused silica play a dominant role in the emission intensity of induced plasma and the volume of material removal, corresponding to the evolution of free-electron, self-trapped excitons, and the phase change of the fused silica left over by the first pulse. For a fluence of 11 J/cm2, the maximum plasma intensity of double-pulse irradiation at an interpulse delay of 120 ps was about 35 times stronger than that of a single-pulse, while the ablated crater was reduced by 27% in volume. The ionization of slow plume component generated by the first pulse was found to be the main reason for the extremely high intensity enhancement for an interpulse delay of over 10 ps.

Due to this reason, methods to improve it is an active research topic. Of particular interest to the current study is the boiling heat transfer process which can potentially be enhanced by the use of nanofluids and textured surfaces. Even though many studies have been conducted to determine the heat transfer ability of nanofluids, controversy exists in the results published so far. We gathered from the literature that the stability of nanofluids used in these works was not reported. Therefore, in this article, we analyzed the effect of nanofluid stability on boiling heat transfer using nanofluids of varying stability. Nanofluids prepared by dispersing functionalized multi-wall carbon nanotubes in ethanol remained stable even after boiling. We confirmed the stability of these nanofluids by comparing the mean particle size of freshly prepared and boiled samples by dynamic light scattering. Conversely, the aqueous nanofluids prepared using functionalized or non-functionalized nanotubes with and without the aid of surfactants, destabilized instantly when boiled. To test the effect of nanofluid stability on boiling heat transfer, we employed each of these nanofluids, and the base liquids ethanol and water to cool a polished heated copper disc. Interestingly, we found that only stable nanofluids cooled the disc faster compared to the base liquid. Since stable nanofluids were shown to enhance boiling heat transfer, we studied the effect of combining stable nanofluids with micro-nanoscale textured metal surfaces. Femtosecond laser micromachining was used to produce laser induced periodic structures and laser inscribed square pillar structures on copper discs, of which the surface morphology was checked using 3D confocal microscopy. We observed a 59% enhancement in the boiling heat transfer rate when stable ethanol based multi-wall carbon nanotube nanofluids were used to cool discs with laser inscribed square pillar texture.",,,,,,0.0

Ambient-temperature time-resolved fluorescence investigations prove the bimodal kinetics of the excited-state electron transfer reaction 1LE→1CT.

Various device parameters were derived from the fits of the observed characteristics. The hole mobilities were nearly equal irrespective of the electrode contacts, whereas the electron mobilities of the transistors with LiF/Al drain electrodes were higher due to the low injection barrier. For the OLEFETs with symmetric electrodes, electroluminescence (EL) occurred only in the vicinity of the hole-injecting electrode, whereas for the OLEFETs with asymmetric electrodes, the emission occurred in the vicinity of both hole- and electron-injecting electrodes.

The result demonstrates that the size (both diameter and height) of convex structures could be tuned by pulse energy; compared with the diameter, the height of convex structures is more sensitive to pulse number and film thickness of surface transparent layer.

The dominant band of authigenic carbonate from Site F ranges from 1084 to 1087 cm−1 while the dominant band from Site P ranges from 1088 to 1091 cm−1, suggesting that compositional differences exist between the samples from the two cold seep areas. The results of the point-counting method indicates that the aragonite content in Site F is higher than that at Site P. The wider peak width of the aragonites at Site P shows the aragonites at Site P have lower degree of crystallinity, which suggests that aragonite is likely to be destroyed when the cold seep weakens or dies. The above information obtained via the Raman spectroscopy can guide sample collection in the deep sea and can be used in conjunction with other analysis methods to better understand environmental changes or the geological processes.",,,,,,0.0

By appropriate adjustment of O2 pressure during the deposition, the grown films exhibited a single-phase hexagonal structure and good crystalline quality. The solid solubility of S in BexZn1-xO1-ySy quaternary alloy was significantly expanded (y ≤ 0.17 or y ≥ 0.35) as a result of simultaneous substitution of cation Zn2+ by smaller Be2+ and anion O2− by bigger S2−. Besides, due to the introduction of BeO with a wide band gap, BeZnOS quaternary films exhibited wider band gaps than the ternary ZnOS films with similar S contents. As the O2 pressure increased from 0.05 Pa to 6 Pa, the band gap of BeZnOS displayed an interesting bowing behavior. The variation range of the band gap was between 3.55 eV and 3.10 eV.

The analysis of optical spectroscopy data has shown that the main reason responsible for the observed phenomenon was a change in the inner coordination spheres of Tb3+ ions. It resulted in an increase in energy gaps between the emitting 5D4 level of the Tb3+ ions and triplet states of ligands. In this way the efficiency of the energy back transfer from the 5D4 level of the Tb3+ ions to the triplet state of the ligands was decreased and the mean photoluminescence intensity of the Tb3+ ions in the film was enhanced.,,,,,,2.0

The rare earth containing mother compounds offer rich physics due to different antiferromagnetic orderings: the alignment of Fe magnetic moments within the FeAs sublattice, which is believed to play a role for the superconducting pairing mechanism, and the ordering of the rare-earth magnetic moments at low temperatures. Here, we present thin film preparation and a film growth study of SmFeAsO on MgO(100) substrates using pulsed laser deposition (PLD). In general, the PLD method is capable to produce iron oxyarsenide thin films, however, competition with impurity phase formation narrows the parameter window. We assume that the film growth in an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environment results in an oxygen-deficient phase, SmFeAsO1−δ. Despite the large lattice misfit, we find epitaxial oxyarsenide thin film growth on MgO(100) with evolving film thickness. Bragg reflections are absent in very thin films although they locally show indications for pseudomorphic growth of the first unit cells. We propose the possibility for a Stranski-Krastanov growth mode as a result of the large in-plane lattice misfit between the iron oxypnictide and the MgO unit cells. A columnar 3-dimensional film growth mode dominates and the surface roughness is determined by growth mounds, a non-negligible parameter for device fabrication as well as in the application of surface sensitive probes. Furthermore, we found evidence for a stratified growth in steps of half a unit cell, i.e. alternating growth of (FeAs)− and (SmO1−δ)+ layers, the basic structural components of the unit cell.

At the molecule/substrate interface, electronic structures are greatly affected by the geometrical structures of adsorbed molecules. In addition, a delicate balance between substrate-molecule and intermolecular interactions plays an important role in the formation of complex polymorphism. In this context, we have clarified the correlation between geometric and electronic structures using a combination of two-photon photoemission (2PPE) spectroscopy, low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Organic ultrathin films of metal phthalocyanines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (naphthalene, rubrene and perylene) on graphite substrates were examined as model systems. Depending on the substrate temperature and coverage, unique morphologies, including well-ordered films, a metastable phase and a two-dimensional gas-like phase, were determined at the molecular level. The data show that variations in molecular orientation have a significant impact on the occupied/unoccupied electronic structures. In addition to static information regarding electronic states, ultrafast electron excitation and relaxation dynamics can be tracked in real time on the femtosecond scale by time-resolved 2PPE spectroscopy. The excited electron dynamics of rubrene films are discussed herein, taking into account structural information, in the presence and absence of an overlap of the wave function with the substrate. Spatial resolution at the molecular level is also obtainable via STM-based local spectroscopy and mapping, which have been utilized to elucidate the spatial extent of unoccupied orbitals in real space. Visible photon emissions from the unoccupied states of perylene monolayer films were observed using 2PPE, representing a characteristic deexcitation process from electronically excited states, depending on the surface structure.

In a field study at the waterway of the hydropower plant (HPP) Fieschertal in the Swiss Alps, the real-time measurement performance of the following techniques and instruments were assessed based on measurements in the sediment seasons of the years 2013 and 2014: (1) turbidimetry, (2) single-frequency acoustic attenuation using a standard acoustic discharge measurement (ADM) installation, (3) laser diffraction (Laser In-Situ Scattering and Transmissometry, LISST), and (4) vibrating tube densimetry using a Coriolis Flow and Density Meter (CFDM). Reference SSCs were obtained from gravimetric analysis of 219 automatically pumped water samples. LISST additionally supplied PSD every minute. The median particle diameter, d50, was usually 15 µm and increased occasionally to 100 µm. The turbidimeter and the ADM underestimated the SSC when the transported particles were coarser than usual. Such temporary biases resulted from the poor correlation between d50 and SSC at this study site. The SSCs from CFDM and LISST were not or less biased by PSD variations. Mainly due to angular and flaky particle shapes, SSC from LISST needed a correction by 79% on average. With the usually prevailing silt particles, an optical path length of 5 mm and no dilution, the SSC measurement range of LISST was limited to about 1.5 g/l.

Among these minerals in sediment, goethite and hematite were more reactive than other minerals to activate H2O2 in the presence of ascorbic acid. Although the initial pH could affect the OH conversion efficiency of H2O2, H2O2 could be decomposed by aquifer sediment at pH 3–11 after the introduction of ascorbic acid. Along with the complete degradation of organic contaminants, the final pH of solution increased to 8.3, which was close to the initial pH (8.9) of groundwater. Moreover, packed column of aquifer sediment could also catalyze the H2O2 conversion to OH for the removal of different organic contaminants with adding ascorbic acid, suggesting a new strategy for in situ chemical oxidation remediation of organic contaminated groundwater.",,,,,,0.0

However, in this unit, the carboxyl group is shut out from the whole conjugation system, which affects the injection of the excited electrons, leading to poor photovoltaic performance. Herein, with the introduction of cyanoacetic acid into the rhodanine segment, two novel indoline sensitizers, CS-22 and CS-24, based on D-π-A construction are designed and synthesized. With this modification, the carboxyl group is conjugated with the whole molecule, leading to sharp enhance of light-harvesting capability of the dye and more important, quite smooth electron injection process. Moreover, the introduced long alkyl chain can also prevent the π-aggregation on TiO2 surface and restrain the charge recombination effectively. Accordingly, using the modified acceptor, the photovoltaic performance is significantly improved: an extremly high PCE of 8.48% is obtained by CS-22 sensitized DSSC, which is the highest value among rhodanine dyes without any co-adsorbent. Our work demonstrates that the introduction of conjugated carboxyl group is greatly benefit for the improvement of rhodanine dyes in photovoltaic performance, providing a powerful strategy for the development of rhodanine based highly efficient D-π-A organic sensitizer in the future.",,,,,,2.0

Here, we studied in detail the effect of hydrothermal conditions on morphology, yield, elemental composition, functional groups, and molecular composition of COM, at temperatures of 250, 300, 350, and 380 °C, pressures of 4, 10, 20, and 24 MPa, and holding times of 0, 30, 60, and 90 min. The holding time influences COM production: longer holding time leads to higher yields and larger particle size. The hydrothermal temperature and pressure, which control the properties of water, have a significant influence on the yield, shape, and particle size of COM. The properties of water affect the COM yields as follows: 1) when the phase of water is liquid, the lower density, viscosity, and static dielectric constant gives higher yields; 2) the yield obtained in supercritical water is higher than that in subcritical water; 3) phase transformation of water from liquid to gas decreases the yield. Additionally, the particle size of COM can be controlled by the temperature, and the pressure affects the shape of COM greatly; even nano-sized particles are produced at 350 °C and 10 MPa. From the molecular composition results, low-molecular weight compounds with small double bond equivalents decompose under supercritical water condition. Large amounts of organic compounds in brown coal are thermally decomposed and extracted under hydrothermal conditions, and then spherical COM particles form and grow from small to big during the cooling process. These results are helpful for clarifying the formation mechanism of COM, and enable control of COM yield and properties.",,,,,,0.0

The entire analytical process consisted of 1 min of protein precipitation and 3 min of chemical labeling in a microwave oven prior to the BP/ALDI-TOF MS analysis.

AuNSs with sharp edges, tips, and corners were used as efficient surface-enhanced resonance Raman scattering (SERRS) substrates for in situ Fenton reaction monitoring. The SERRS intensity of the EV showed a first-order decay curve with a reaction rate constant value of 0.0263 min−1, while the decolorization yielded second-order kinetic behavior with a constant value of 0.00430 L/mol min.

Of particular interest in these domains is the use of confocal microscopy to investigate temperature-dependent phenomena such as self-assembly, diffusio- or thermophoresis, or crystal growth. Several hurdles must be solved to develop a temperature-controlled stage for laser scanning confocal microscopy, in particular regarding the influence of an elevated temperature gradient close to the microscope objective, which most people try very hard to avoid. Here we report the design of a temperature-controlled stage able to generate stable temperature gradients in both positive and negative temperature range and does not require use of liquid nitrogen.

The room temperature X-ray powder diffraction study and density functional theory (DFT) calculations show consistently that incorporated trivalent neodymium ions occupy calcium dodecahedral sites, whereas ousted part of calcium ions moves into yttrium/holmium octahedral sites.

In addition, we evaluated the contribution of clay content and soils' initial organic matter on the assessed detection limit for each sensor. Large spectral variations were found between soils with the same organic matter content and between the two sensors when calculating the detection limit.

Suitable criteria are required to identify promising targets for further molecular biomarkers. Possible criteria include the Hydrogen-to-Carbon (H/C) atomic ratio used as a proxy of the aliphatic content of the kerogen matrix. However, H/C ratio values exhibit large variation in Archean kerogens and their significance remains poorly understood. In this study, we thus investigate the significance of the H/C ratios of Archean kerogens by combining elemental analyses, Nanoscale Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (NanoSIMS), Rock-Eval pyrolysis and Raman spectroscopy. First, NanoSIMS investigations show the H/C ratio of kerogen can be compromised by residual minerals. In addition, Rock-Eval pyrolysis underlines the fact that thermal cracking of Archean kerogens does not just release hydrocarbon covalently linked to the macromolecular network but also a complex mixture of organic pools distinguished by their thermal maturity. Therefore, the H/C ratio alone cannot be used to probe the preservation of aliphatic compounds bound to kerogen since it can be biased by the presence of (i) residual bitumen, as well as (ii) refractory organic matter in secondary hydrothermal veins whose syngenecity is debatable. Rock-Eval pyrolysis then provides a useful and complementary method to check the significance of H/C atomic ratio as a proxy for hydrocarbon preservation in Archean kerogens.",,,,,,0.0

We explored two different methods of dual-layer casting: (i) layer by layer and (ii) simultaneous dual layer fabrication. The influence of these methods on the characteristics of the prepared membranes were investigated. The hydrophilicity of the top surface was ensured by blending appropriate quantity of polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) into the polymer dope so that the feed water and its organic pollutant content have adequate contact with the membrane surface containing the CNT. Dynamic contact angle data revealed that CNT blend PVDF membranes were highly hydrophilic when compared to their pristine counterparts. Single layer and simultaneous cast double layer blend membranes showed bigger pores (∼10 μm), whereas layer-by-layer cast double layer blend membrane showed acceptable lower mean pore size (∼0.25 μm). Adsorption experiments were done using methylene blue (MB) as a model adsorbate. Composite membranes performed better in the removal of MB, while also showing high rate of filtration.

As a result, with the use of Fe3O4@PDA@ZrMOF, the detection limits of 4-nitrocatechol and 4-nitroguaiacol were estimated to be about 68 μg/ml and 25 μg/ml, respectively. In addition, enrichment of nitrophenols from PM2.5 was investigated. The detected mass concentrations of 4-nitrocatechol and 4-nitroguaiacol in collected PM2.5 samples were 0.11 ng/m3 and 0.15 ng/m3, respectively, indicating the highly efficient enrichment performance of Fe3O4@PDA@ZrMOF for low-abundance nitrophenol compounds in the environment.",,,,,,0.0

However, most laser damage reports focus on the films standing on substrates, and the intrinsic laser damage behaviors of the silica nanoparticle films are poorly understood due to the influence of the substrates. Here, we investigate the ultraviolet laser damage behaviors of the freestanding silica nanoparticle films. We find that silica nanoparitcle films demonstrate higher laser damage threshold than the fused silica substrates under the irradiation of 355-nm laser. For the films on the fused silica substrates, the laser damage is caused by the substrates. In the case of freestanding films, laser-damage resistance is strongly dependent on the film thickness and the amount of organic groups in the films. The laser damage threshold increases from 103 to 159 J/cm2 @ 355 nm with decreasing the film thickness from 322 to 31 nm. In addition, removal of organic groups from the films results in higher laser damage threshold.

As a proof of concept, the migration of copper ions present in aqueous solution to the solid phase and their direct measurement by laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) was evaluated. The main parameters that affected the extraction (paper type and sonication time) and analyte detection in the solid phase (delay, spot size and accumulated number of pulses) were optimised in a univariate way. The conditions influencing the complexation reaction and formation of the ion pair in aqueous solution (pH and copper, SPADNS and DTAB concentrations) were set according to a previous study. Under the optimised conditions, it was possible to use this extraction technology as an alternative in determining copper content in aqueous solutions by LIBS, overcoming the intrinsic difficulties of this instrumental technique in the analysis of liquid samples.

However, the role of LA-PLA synthesis parameters is not yet fully agreed. This work seeks to optimize the production of nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) particles suitable for biomedical or environmental applications using nanosecond LA-PLA on iron targets with different ablation media, laser and target scanning parameters. The use of alcohols as solvents produces iron-iron oxide core-shell nanoparticles with amorphous cores, except for a small crystalline fraction corresponding to the biggest core sizes. Decreasing carbon chain length and complexity leads to a thinning of the carbonaceous material coatings and an increase of the colloidal stability and the nanoparticle productivity. Moreover, a decrease of solvent density and surface tension allows obtaining reduced sizes and polydispersity values. Among, laser and scanning parameters, the pulse accumulation per spot displayed a clear effect in boosting size and productivity.

Temporal records compiled for a number of trace elements show a relatively wide spread in concentrations spanning several orders of magnitude within a single deposit. It has been suggested that this spread is present in both bulk rock digestion and laser ablation data, however, the comparability of data from the two methods has not been thoroughly evaluated. Here, we provide a statistical assessment of how comparable laser ablation data of individual BIF hematite and magnetite grains are to one another, as well as how closely averages of laser ablation data approximate bulk rock values. To do so, we use (laser ablation)-high resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ((LA)-HR-ICP-MS) data from 14 BIF slabs and corresponding powders that span four different formations. We focus in particular on BIF from the ≥3.75 Ga Nuvvuagittuq Supracrustal Belt (Québec, Canada) and multiple BIF deposits of the 2.6–2.45 Ga Hamersley Group (North Western Australia), representing deposits separated by over a billion years and of differing metamorphic grade. The scaling between selected transition metals is also evaluated in light of expectations for possible delivery mechanisms of trace elements from seawater to BIF precursor sediments – the adsorption to hydrous ferric oxides, biological vectors, and detrital influence. Our findings show that average trace element concentrations between bulk versus laser ablation data typically vary within an order of magnitude. Furthermore, reproducibility between the two methods appears to be independent of formation age, metamorphic grade, or depositional setting. These findings underscore the overall fidelity of the BIF record at capturing seawater compositional signatures at various scales. We demonstrate that evaluations of ancient seawater chemistry using the BIF record are best served by a combined approach utilizing both bulk rock and laser ablation data, as bulk methods offer the most conservative proxy data for ancient seawater composition but may mask significant enrichments or depletions that are detectable at the grain-scale by laser ablation.",,,,,,0.0

As a result of plasma-induced radical reactions, the formation of stable products including molecular H2 and H2O2 was identified and quantified as a function of irradiation time, repetition rate and pulse energies up to 1 mJ. The observed dependencies provided new insight into the basic chemical processes taking place in the plasma generated in water by focused laser pulses. It was found that the energy efficiency of hydrogen production increased with the decrease of pulse energy and repetition rate. Under appropriate irradiation conditions, an advantageous stoichiometry of water decomposition only into pure H2 and H2O2 (without O2) was achieved. An original way of process intensification (a series of separate laser beams of adequately low energy generating plasma at different places, a sufficiently fast water flow through the irradiation zones) was proposed in order to improve the energy yield of hydrogen generation and to ensure the evolution of pure hydrogen as the only gaseous product of the water splitting. Taking into account the suggested solution, the predicted energy efficiency of hydrogen production of 0.4 g H2/kWh was found to be comparable to other plasma methods for H2 generation. Our results show that direct production of pure H2 using femtosecond laser pulses is a fully reasonable process that carries considerable potential for both research and application.",,,,,,0.0

Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has also been suggested for the same purpose, mainly for vegetable samples. However, LIBS has failed to provide adequate results in many cases due to sample matrix complexity, and NIRS performance is harmed because of its lack of sensitivity and indirect correlation with inorganic elemental species. In this work, the performance of these two techniques are compared for the determination of micro- and macroelements in vegetable samples (Brachiaria forages) using multivariate regression. In addition, a data fusion scheme, in which spectral data sourced by NIRS is integrated with LIBS, is proposed to improve elemental content determination in those samples. The information of the molecular composition detected by NIR vibrational spectroscopy was consistently selected by recursive partial least squares to yield quantitative multivariate models for K, Ca, Mg, Mn and Fe in forage plants that are superior to models based on the use of individual NIRS and LIBS spectral information. While all data fusion models showed better predictive accuracy than any of the two individual techniques, best results were observed for Ca.

Likewise, it is shown here that the equations of motion for the p-H2 pumped RASER result from a set of order parameters, where the transverse magnetization of the RASER-active spin states enslaves the electromagnetic modes. The consequences are striking for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, since long-lasting multi-mode RASER oscillations enable unprecedented spectroscopic resolution down to the micro-Hertz regime.

The structural, morphological, and optical characteristics of the as-synthesized Au-NPs were evaluated as a function of varied laser energies and repetition rates. Optical traits of Au-NPs were analyzed by ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) absorption, photoluminescence, and Raman spectroscopy. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) absorbance at the excitation wavelength of 633 nm was recorded to find the shape of the Au-NPs. Attenuated total reflection infrared (ATR-IR) spectra was obtained to verify the achieved Au-NPs purity. High-resolution transmission electron micrographs approved the nucleation of spherical colloidal Au-NPs (mean diameter of 7 to 30 nm) in deionized water. The UV–Vis spectra of Au-NPs disclosed the occurrences of SPR peaks in the range of 521 to 524 nm accompanied by blue-shift. The UV absorption edge of the UV–Vis spectra was used to determine the optical band gap energies of the produced Au-NPs which were further confirmed by the photoluminescence spectral analyses. Present findings based on PLAL-assisted synthesis of pure Au-NPs may be beneficial for the development photocatalysis and solar cells.",,,,,,0.0

Studying bacterial metabolism at the microaggregate scale (100–300 μm) may unmask important microscale biogeochemical relationships amongst bacterial processes and the surrounding soil. Biological laser printer technology was used to sample soil core sections (ca. one mm thick) into ca. 100–300 μm microaggregates. Bacterial production was measured on collections of five microaggregates each (180 samples over 5 cm depth profile) by suspending microaggregates into filtered rainwater with 3H-leucine and incubating for 4 h. Bacterial production varied by over two orders of magnitude amongst groups of five microaggregates collected over the same millimeter scale core slice. Range for all measurements along the core was below detection (0.005) to 897 fg C aggregate d−1. As expected, variability amongst adjacent (within 2 mm of each other) microaggregates groups generally decreased with depth along with the total magnitude of bacterial production rate. Variation in bacterial production at the microaggregate scale was greater than that seen at larger scale (ca. 50 mg; theoretical 3200 microaggregates) sampling of the same core. This is the first demonstration of using a biological laser printer for fine scale sampling of soil core slices and subsequent measurement of bacterial metabolism.",,,,,,0.0

Here we demonstrated a simple yet efficient way to enhance the responsitivity of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3)-based photodetectors by utilizing organic semiconductors (OSCs) to form MAPbI3/OSC bilayer structures. These bilayer photodetectors are fabricated with a facile and low-cost spin-coating method, yet the responsitivity can be more than one order of magnitude higher than that of pristine MAPbI3 photodetectors. More importantly, the physics behind the enhancement of responsitivity was analyzed and revealed by inspecting the physical processes in terms of light absorption, exciton dissociation and charge transport. The results indicate that the responsitivity enhancement is mainly attributable to the more efficient exciton dissociation and hole transport processes in the bilayer photodetectors.",,,,,,0.0

The SAs are prepared by the core-shell microbeads with Raman reporter molecules doped inside and elementary encoded nanoparticles (EENPs) assembled on the surface. Raman scattering spectra and LIBS spectra are obtained after excitation by laser, the specific peaks from the spectra are used for decoding. Highly sensitive and selective recognition of dual-digital encoded SA are realized by immunoassay experiments with a detection limit of 9.17 pM. Owing to the narrow bandwidths and unchangeable read-out wavelengths, the above two types of spectra provide high accuracy and stability for encoding. Meanwhile, Raman and LIBS spectra are independent from fluorescence, thus the cross talk between the encoding signal and fluorescent label on analytes can be avoided. Moreover, since the coding number grows exponentially along with the increase of types of encoding materials, the combination of two channels promote a considerable rise in detection throughput. All the above properties demonstrate the unique potential of dual-digital encoded SA in high-throughput biological detection.",,,,,,0.0

Using a novel dataset from Monterey Canyon, offshore central California, that includes an extensive array of water column sampling devices, we address how fine-grained sediment and organic carbon are transported, mixed, fractionated, and buried along a submarine canyon. Anderson-type sediment traps were deployed 10–300 m above the seafloor on a suite of moorings anchored between 278 and 1849 m water depths along the axial channel of Monterey Canyon during three consecutive 6-month deployments (2015–2017). Tidal currents within the canyon suspended and transported fine-grained sediment and organic carbon that were captured in sediment traps, which record the composition of sediment and organic carbon transport along the canyon. High sediment accumulation rates in traps increased up-canyon and near the seafloor, where fine-scale (<1 cm) layering was increasingly distinctive in CT scans. There was no along-canyon trend in the organic carbon composition (percent modern carbon and isotopic signatures) among trap locations, suggesting effective mixing. Organic carbon content (weight percent total organic carbon) and excess 210Pb activities (dpm/g) increased down-canyon, reflecting reduced flux of sediment and organic carbon into deeper water, more distal traps. Differing organic carbon signatures in traps compared with previous measurements of seabed deposits along Monterey Canyon suggest that organic carbon transported through the canyon with internal tides may not be consistently recorded in seafloor deposits. First-order estimates from comparing organic carbon content of core and trap samples results in low organic carbon specific burial efficiency (ranging from ~26% to ~0.1%) and suggests that the modern upper Monterey Canyon may not be an effective sink for carbon. Organic carbon isotopic signatures from sediment traps in the water column show more marine influence than seafloor sediment cores; this is likely due to the deposition and reworking of seafloor deposits by sediment density flows and preferential consumption of fresh marine organic carbon on the seafloor, which is better preserved in the traps. Sediment and remaining organic carbon in canyon floor and lower flank deposits preferentially reflect episodic sediment density flow events that are unrelated to internal tides. This study provides a quantified example and conceptual model for internal-tide-related sediment and organic carbon transport, mixing, and burial trends along a submarine canyon that are likely to be similar in many canyons worldwide.",,,,,,0.0

Evidence of p-type doping and a reduction of mobility of electrons in RGO upon deposition of these materials is observed. Time-resolved photocurrent measurements show a reduction in electron mobility even at submonolayer coverage of these materials. The variation of transit time with different coverages reveals that electron mobility decreases with increasing the surface coverage of 1-PSA, TCNE and F4-TCNQ to a certain extent, while at higher coverage the electron mobility is slightly recovered. All three molecules show the same trend in charge carrier mobility variation with coverage, but with different magnitude.

Gadolinium-based contrast agents were used as model metallodrugs with a significant relevance for pharmaceutical applications. Challenges regarding the ablation of the complex blood-filter matrix were characterized and successfully addressed by a thorough adaption of the laser ablation conditions. Especially the laser fluence was optimized with respect to the particle size distribution of the generated aerosol as monitored by an optical particle counter. Thus, generation of micrometer-sized particles could be minimized in favor of smaller particles increasing the transport efficiency of the DBS ablation aerosol to the plasma and the recorded signal stability. Inhomogeneous blood drying on the porous filter paper could be compensated by the addition of an internal standard prior to blood spotting. To preserve the advantages of DBS sampling, such as small blood volumes and minimal invasiveness, the combined use of DBS and a capillary blood sampling system is demonstrated. By placing the internal standard into the capillary prior to blood sampling, a simple workflow usable for clinical application was implemented.

MSI can potentially open a new avenue to ultra-high resolution molecular stratigraphy by resolving the fine-scale distribution of molecular biomarkers in geological records. However, ionization of organic molecules within their sediment matrix remains a critical challenge. Building on the recent introduction of MSI of archaeal tetraether lipids, we have extended the analytical spectrum to additional biomarkers and provide guidelines for the generation of multiproxy, ultra-high resolution paleoenvironmental records. We evaluated the addition of artificial matrices to promote ionization, defined the most suitable MS settings, and increased analytical complexity from pure compounds to their investigation in sediment. Most compounds relevant to molecular stratigraphy are not properly ionized in the presence of conventional matrices, but require atypical ones, such as those based on carbon or silver. Sediments serve as a natural matrix, directly allowing detection of many of these compounds. However, the sediment matrix also inhibits some reactions that otherwise promote detection, such as derivatization of alkenones or silver-mediated ionization of n-alkanes. The robustness of MSI-based molecular stratigraphy is enhanced by analysis of target compounds in narrow m/z ranges, and by summation of mass spectra from several coeval measurement spots.

It is said that a hybrid water treatment system incorporating more physicochemical than biological processes for the removal of organic matter can be more convenient and incur less cost compared with a conventional activated sludge systems. Therefore, in this study, we propose a hybrid water treatment system equipped with a jet mixed separator (JMS), which is a type of pre-coagulation-sedimentation tank, and an aerobic moving bed biofilter (MBB). We then investigate the behaviour of particulate and soluble organic matter and the oxygen consumption by the biofilm in this hybrid system. The results indicate that the addition of the poly silicate iron coagulant in JMS increases the quantity of removed organic matter by approximately 30% compared with the process without coagulant, and that the majority of the removed organic matter is soluble.

The residual organic matter of JMS was removed from the liquid phase within an hour, which is the hydraulic retention time (HRT) of MBB, and the removed soluble organic matter was almost perfectly biodegraded in the biofilm within a day. That is, MBB could continuously operate without excess growth of microorganisms as long as the filtering was working properly.

The aim of this study is to use remote sensing data to characterize post-fire severity at tree level in a mixed conifer forest following the Cascade and East Zone megafires of 2007 in central Idaho, USA. We used remote sensing metrics derived from Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data (2008) and high-resolution QuickBird (QB) multispectral satellite imagery (2007–2009) for calibrating and validating predictive models with field data (2008). We compared fire effects on trees in open canopies within recent fuel treatments to similar trees in closed canopies on adjacent, untreated sites. We observed more trees with charred crowns in high fire severity sites, mostly untreated, whereas we observed more trees with live crowns in low fire severity sites, independent of the treatment. Individual trees were more accurately detected from ALS data in treated sites with open canopies than untreated sites with closed canopies. For detected trees, the response variables predicted from ALS and QB metrics were total height (Ht), crown base height (CBH), total basal area (BAT), live basal area (BAL), scorched basal area (BAS), charred basal area (BAC) and crown severity (CS). None of the selected QB metrics were strongly correlated with the selected ALS metrics, which justified combining both data types into the predictive models. Random Forest regression models combining ALS + QB metrics or using ALS metrics alone performed similarly but clearly better than models using only QB metrics. This study shows the superiority of ALS data to high resolution, multispectral QB imagery for mapping fire severity at tree level.

There are just a few compounds with rate constants established using different techniques in different laboratories. kSO4−’s determined in different laboratories by the direct techniques, pulse radiolysis or laser flash photolysis, in most cases agree reasonably. The values determined by competitive experimental techniques, by complex kinetics calculations, or by modelling show a large scatter. Some of these techniques seem to be questionable for kSO4− determination. The sulfate radical anion reacts with ketone and amine moieties of molecules by electron transfer. The same mechanism is also suggested for the reaction with aromatic rings. However, in a few cases addition to the double bond and sulfate anion elimination reactions were distinguished.

Lattice structures of titanium alloys are in high demand for biomedical applications and are particularly useful as bone substitutes. A series of lattice structures with pore diameters of 500, 600, and 700 μm and porosities of 60% and 70% were designed by repeating an octahedral unit cell. Based on SEM and micro-CT observations, good morphological agreement was detected between the original designs and the SLM-produced structures. Microstructural analysis using TEM showed that the typically acicular α′ martensitic microstructure was obtained in the strut, which contributes to the brittle behavior of the lattice structure. Uniaxial compression tests were conducted, and the deformation behavior was recorded using a digital camera. Finite element analysis (FEA) of compression process was also conducted to enhance the understanding of the deformation mechanism. The surface chemistry of the lattice structure was analyzed using XPS methodology. The cytocompatibility of the lattice was also investigated with an in vitro test.

Because of the phonon soften by the AgNW surface and internal twin boundaries scattering, the Debye temperature of the AgNW (223 K) is lower than that of the bulk silver (235 K), while the electron-phonon coupling constant of the AgNW (1.19 × 10−7 Ω·m) is higher than that of the bulk (5.24 × 10−8 Ω·m).

Specifically, a practical secondary wastewater of coal chemical industry was used as the feed solution, and was fractionated into six hydrophobic/hydrophilic acid/base/neutral portions. RO membrane fouling behaviors at different stages were critically described using two characteristic parameters, i.e., initial flux decline rate and final steady-state flux. These parameters were quantified using Michaelis-Menten relation as a model fitting method. In general, the hydrophilic neutral (HIN) and hydrophobic neutral (HON) fractions had the fastest initial fouling rate and the lowest steady-state flux, mainly due to their high contents of polysaccharide. Among the organic constituents (polysaccharide/protein/humic acid), polysaccharide was the most responsible for rapid initial flux decline and low final steady-state flux, as proved by Kendall’s correlation. Among the inorganic constituents (Ca/Mg/Si), Si was found to exert the greatest influence on the final steady-state flux. This indicates that polysaccharide and Si played a combined role in determining the foulant layer permeability at the prolonged fouling stage, and a possible mechanism is that Si might alter the structure of polysaccharide gel layer.

However, establishing whether these kerogens are indeed syngenetic with the deposition of associated sedimentary host rocks, or contain contribution from episodes of secondary deposition, is not straightforward. Novel geochemical criterions are therefore required to test the syngenetic origin of Archean organic materials. On the one hand, the occurrence of mass-independent fractionation of sulphur isotopes (MIF-S) provides a tool to test the Archean origin of ancient sedimentary rocks. Determining the isotope composition of sulphur within kerogens whilst limiting the contribution from associated minerals (e.g., nano-pyrites) is however challenging. On the other hand, the Xe isotope composition of the Archean atmosphere has been shown to present enrichments in the light isotopes relative to its modern composition, together with a mono-isotopic deficit in 129Xe. Given that the isotopic composition of atmospheric Xe evolved through time by mass dependent fractionation (MDF) until ~2.5 to 2.0 Ga, the degree of MDF of Xe isotopes trapped in kerogens could provide a time stamp for the last chemical equilibration between organic matter and the atmosphere. However, the extent to which geological processes could affect the signature of Xe trapped in ancient kerogen remains unclear. In this contribution, we present new Ar, Kr and Xe isotopic data for four kerogens isolated from 3.4 to 1.8 Gy-old cherts and confirm that Xe isotopes from the Archean atmosphere can be retained within kerogens. However, new Xe-derived model ages are lower than expected from the ages of host rocks, indicating that initially trapped Xe components were at least partially lost and/or mixed together with some Xe carried out by younger generations of organic materials, therefore complicating the Xe-based dating method. Whilst non-null Δ33S values and 129Xe deficits relative to modern atmosphere constitute reliable imprints from the Archean atmosphere, using Xe isotopes to provide information on the syngenetic origin of ancient organic matter appears to be a promising – but not unequivocal – tool that calls for further analytical development.",,,,,,0.0

This relationship has been confirmed by measuring the total protein in the same samples conventionally. The relation between calcium and protein percentage has also been demonstrated.

Pyrolusite, a natural manganese oxide ore, was used for the oxidative degradation and mineralization of the organics, and reduction leaching of Mn from the pyrolusite occurred simultaneously. The total organic carbon (TOC) removal and Mn leaching efficiency were 46% and 16.44%, respectively. In addition, pyrites was applied as a reductant to extract Mn from the pyrolusite, and an Mn leaching efficiency of 98.31% was obtained under the optimized conditions of 4/1 liquid/solid ratio, 350 rpm stirring speed, 1.5 mol L−1 H2SO4 concentration, and 95 °C for 1 h in the first oxidative degradation stage and a molar ratio of FeS2/MnO2 of 0.55/1 for 4 h in the reduction leaching stage. Subsequently, a combined treatment of MnO2/activated carbon was developed for further oxidation and adsorption of the organics in the solution, with the TOC removal of 84.11%. The resulting purified MnSO4 solution was concentrated to produce qualified MnSO4∙H2O, which met the requirements of an industrial product. This technology showed application potential in highly-efficient removal of hazardous organic contaminates.",,,,,,0.0
